<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> a portion of the first half
of the present century, and more particularly during the latter
part of it, there flourished and practised in the city of New
York a physician who enjoyed perhaps an exceptional share of the
consideration which, in the United States, has always been
bestowed upon distinguished members of the medical
profession.&nbsp; This profession in America has constantly been
held in honour, and more successfully than elsewhere has put
forward a claim to the epithet of &ldquo;liberal.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
a country in which, to play a social part, you must either earn
your income or make believe that you earn it, the healing art has
appeared in a high degree to combine two recognised sources of
credit.&nbsp; It belongs to the realm of the practical, which in
the United States is a great recommendation; and it is touched by
the light of science&mdash;a merit appreciated in a community in
which the love of knowledge has not always been accompanied by
leisure and opportunity.&nbsp; It was an element in Dr.
Sloper&rsquo;s reputation that his learning and his skill were
very evenly balanced; he was what you might call a scholarly
doctor, and yet there was nothing abstract in his
remedies&mdash;he always ordered you to take something.&nbsp;
Though he was felt to be extremely thorough, he was not
uncomfortably theoretic, and if he sometimes explained matters
rather more minutely than might seem of use to the patient, he
never went so far (like some practitioners one has heard of) as
to trust to the explanation alone, but always left behind him an
inscrutable prescription.&nbsp; There were some doctors that left
the prescription without offering any explanation at all; and he
did not belong to that class either, which was, after all, the
most vulgar.&nbsp; It will be seen that I am describing a clever
man; and this is really the reason why Dr. Sloper had become a
local celebrity.&nbsp; At the time at which we are chiefly
concerned with him, he was some fifty years of age, and his
popularity was at its height.&nbsp; He was very witty, and he
passed in the best society of New York for a man of the
world&mdash;which, indeed, he was, in a very sufficient
degree.&nbsp; I hasten to add, to anticipate possible
misconception, that he was not the least of a charlatan.&nbsp; He
was a thoroughly honest man&mdash;honest in a degree of which he
had perhaps lacked the opportunity to give the complete measure;
and, putting aside the great good-nature of the circle in which
he practised, which was rather fond of boasting that it possessed
the &ldquo;brightest&rdquo; doctor in the country, he daily
justified his claim to the talents attributed to him by the
popular voice.&nbsp; He was an observer, even a philosopher, and
to be bright was so natural to him, and (as the popular voice
said) came so easily, that he never aimed at mere effect, and had
none of the little tricks and pretensions of second-rate
reputations.&nbsp; It must be confessed that fortune had favoured
him, and that he had found the path to prosperity very soft to
his tread.&nbsp; He had married at the age of twenty-seven, for
love, a very charming girl, Miss Catherine Harrington, of New
York, who, in addition to her charms, had brought him a solid
dowry.&nbsp; Mrs. Sloper was amiable, graceful, accomplished,
elegant, and in 1820 she had been one of the pretty girls of the
small but promising capital which clustered about the Battery and
overlooked the Bay, and of which the uppermost boundary was
indicated by the grassy waysides of Canal Street.&nbsp; Even at
the age of twenty-seven Austin Sloper had made his mark
sufficiently to mitigate the anomaly of his having been chosen
among a dozen suitors by a young woman of high fashion, who had
ten thousand dollars of income and the most charming eyes in the
island of Manhattan.&nbsp; These eyes, and some of their
accompaniments, were for about five years a source of extreme
satisfaction to the young physician, who was both a devoted and a
very happy husband.&nbsp; The fact of his having married a rich
woman made no difference in the line he had traced for himself,
and he cultivated his profession with as definite a purpose as if
he still had no other resources than his fraction of the modest
patrimony which on his father&rsquo;s death he had shared with
his brothers and sisters.&nbsp; This purpose had not been
preponderantly to make money&mdash;it had been rather to learn
something and to do something.&nbsp; To learn something
interesting, and to do something useful&mdash;this was, roughly
speaking, the programme he had sketched, and of which the
accident of his wife having an income appeared to him in no
degree to modify the validity.&nbsp; He was fond of his practice,
and of exercising a skill of which he was agreeably conscious,
and it was so patent a truth that if he were not a doctor there
was nothing else he could be, that a doctor he persisted in
being, in the best possible conditions.&nbsp; Of course his easy
domestic situation saved him a good deal of drudgery, and his
wife&rsquo;s affiliation to the &ldquo;best people&rdquo; brought
him a good many of those patients whose symptoms are, if not more
interesting in themselves than those of the lower orders, at
least more consistently displayed.&nbsp; He desired experience,
and in the course of twenty years he got a great deal.&nbsp; It
must be added that it came to him in some forms which, whatever
might have been their intrinsic value, made it the reverse of
welcome.&nbsp; His first child, a little boy of extraordinary
promise, as the Doctor, who was not addicted to easy enthusiasms,
firmly believed, died at three years of age, in spite of
everything that the mother&rsquo;s tenderness and the
father&rsquo;s science could invent to save him.&nbsp; Two years
later Mrs. Sloper gave birth to a second infant&mdash;an infant
of a sex which rendered the poor child, to the Doctor&rsquo;s
sense, an inadequate substitute for his lamented first-born, of
whom he had promised himself to make an admirable man.&nbsp; The
little girl was a disappointment; but this was not the
worst.&nbsp; A week after her birth the young mother, who, as the
phrase is, had been doing well, suddenly betrayed alarming
symptoms, and before another week had elapsed Austin Sloper was a
widower.</p>
<p>For a man whose trade was to keep people alive, he had
certainly done poorly in his own family; and a bright doctor who
within three years loses his wife and his little boy should
perhaps be prepared to see either his skill or his affection
impugned.&nbsp; Our friend, however, escaped criticism: that is,
he escaped all criticism but his own, which was much the most
competent and most formidable.&nbsp; He walked under the weight
of this very private censure for the rest of his days, and bore
for ever the scars of a castigation to which the strongest hand
he knew had treated him on the night that followed his
wife&rsquo;s death.&nbsp; The world, which, as I have said,
appreciated him, pitied him too much to be ironical; his
misfortune made him more interesting, and even helped him to be
the fashion.&nbsp; It was observed that even medical families
cannot escape the more insidious forms of disease, and that,
after all, Dr. Sloper had lost other patients beside the two I
have mentioned; which constituted an honourable precedent.&nbsp;
His little girl remained to him, and though she was not what he
had desired, he proposed to himself to make the best of
her.&nbsp; He had on hand a stock of unexpended authority, by
which the child, in its early years, profited largely.&nbsp; She
had been named, as a matter of course, after her poor mother, and
even in her most diminutive babyhood the Doctor never called her
anything but Catherine.&nbsp; She grew up a very robust and
healthy child, and her father, as he looked at her, often said to
himself that, such as she was, he at least need have no fear of
losing her.&nbsp; I say &ldquo;such as she was,&rdquo; because,
to tell the truth&mdash;But this is a truth of which I will defer
the telling.</p>
<h2><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the child was about ten years
old, he invited his sister, Mrs. Penniman, to come and stay with
him.&nbsp; The Miss Slopers had been but two in number, and both
of them had married early in life.&nbsp; The younger, Mrs. Almond
by name, was the wife of a prosperous merchant, and the mother of
a blooming family.&nbsp; She bloomed herself, indeed, and was a
comely, comfortable, reasonable woman, and a favourite with her
clever brother, who, in the matter of women, even when they were
nearly related to him, was a man of distinct preferences.&nbsp;
He preferred Mrs. Almond to his sister Lavinia, who had married a
poor clergyman, of a sickly constitution and a flowery style of
eloquence, and then, at the age of thirty-three, had been left a
widow, without children, without fortune&mdash;with nothing but
the memory of Mr. Penniman&rsquo;s flowers of speech, a certain
vague aroma of which hovered about her own conversation.&nbsp;
Nevertheless he had offered her a home under his own roof, which
Lavinia accepted with the alacrity of a woman who had spent the
ten years of her married life in the town of Poughkeepsie.&nbsp;
The Doctor had not proposed to Mrs. Penniman to come and live
with him indefinitely; he had suggested that she should make an
asylum of his house while she looked about for unfurnished
lodgings.&nbsp; It is uncertain whether Mrs. Penniman ever
instituted a search for unfurnished lodgings, but it is beyond
dispute that she never found them.&nbsp; She settled herself with
her brother and never went away, and when Catherine was twenty
years old her Aunt Lavinia was still one of the most striking
features of her immediate <i>entourage</i>.&nbsp; Mrs.
Penniman&rsquo;s own account of the matter was that she had
remained to take charge of her niece&rsquo;s education.&nbsp; She
had given this account, at least, to every one but the Doctor,
who never asked for explanations which he could entertain himself
any day with inventing.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman, moreover, though she
had a good deal of a certain sort of artificial assurance,
shrank, for indefinable reasons, from presenting herself to her
brother as a fountain of instruction.&nbsp; She had not a high
sense of humour, but she had enough to prevent her from making
this mistake; and her brother, on his side, had enough to excuse
her, in her situation, for laying him under contribution during a
considerable part of a lifetime.&nbsp; He therefore assented
tacitly to the proposition which Mrs. Penniman had tacitly laid
down, that it was of importance that the poor motherless girl
should have a brilliant woman near her.&nbsp; His assent could
only be tacit, for he had never been dazzled by his
sister&rsquo;s intellectual lustre.&nbsp; Save when he fell in
love with Catherine Harrington, he had never been dazzled,
indeed, by any feminine characteristics whatever; and though he
was to a certain extent what is called a ladies&rsquo; doctor,
his private opinion of the more complicated sex was not
exalted.&nbsp; He regarded its complications as more curious than
edifying, and he had an idea of the beauty of <i>reason</i>,
which was, on the whole, meagrely gratified by what he observed
in his female patients.&nbsp; His wife had been a reasonable
woman, but she was a bright exception; among several things that
he was sure of, this was perhaps the principal.&nbsp; Such a
conviction, of course, did little either to mitigate or to
abbreviate his widowhood; and it set a limit to his recognition,
at the best, of Catherine&rsquo;s possibilities and of Mrs.
Penniman&rsquo;s ministrations.&nbsp; He, nevertheless, at the
end of six months, accepted his sister&rsquo;s permanent presence
as an accomplished fact, and as Catherine grew older perceived
that there were in effect good reasons why she should have a
companion of her own imperfect sex.&nbsp; He was extremely polite
to Lavinia, scrupulously, formally polite; and she had never seen
him in anger but once in her life, when he lost his temper in a
theological discussion with her late husband.&nbsp; With her he
never discussed theology, nor, indeed, discussed anything; he
contented himself with making known, very distinctly, in the form
of a lucid ultimatum, his wishes with regard to Catherine.</p>
<p>Once, when the girl was about twelve years old, he had said to
her:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try and make a clever woman of her, Lavinia; I should
like her to be a clever woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, at this, looked thoughtful a moment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My dear Austin,&rdquo; she then inquired, &ldquo;do you
think it is better to be clever than to be good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for what?&rdquo; asked the Doctor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are good for nothing unless you are clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this assertion Mrs. Penniman saw no reason to dissent;
she possibly reflected that her own great use in the world was
owing to her aptitude for many things.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course I wish Catherine to be good,&rdquo; the
Doctor said next day; &ldquo;but she won&rsquo;t be any the less
virtuous for not being a fool.&nbsp; I am not afraid of her being
wicked; she will never have the salt of malice in her
character.&nbsp; She is as good as good bread, as the French say;
but six years hence I don&rsquo;t want to have to compare her to
good bread and butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid she will turn insipid?&nbsp; My dear
brother, it is I who supply the butter; so you needn&rsquo;t
fear!&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, who had taken in hand the
child&rsquo;s accomplishments, overlooking her at the piano,
where Catherine displayed a certain talent, and going with her to
the dancing-class, where it must be confessed that she made but a
modest figure.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was a tall, thin, fair, rather faded woman, with
a perfectly amiable disposition, a high standard of gentility, a
taste for light literature, and a certain foolish indirectness
and obliquity of character.&nbsp; She was romantic, she was
sentimental, she had a passion for little secrets and
mysteries&mdash;a very innocent passion, for her secrets had
hitherto always been as unpractical as addled eggs.&nbsp; She was
not absolutely veracious; but this defect was of no great
consequence, for she had never had anything to conceal.&nbsp; She
would have liked to have a lover, and to correspond with him
under an assumed name in letters left at a shop; I am bound to
say that her imagination never carried the intimacy farther than
this.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman had never had a lover, but her brother,
who was very shrewd, understood her turn of mind.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When Catherine is about seventeen,&rdquo; he said to
himself, &ldquo;Lavinia will try and persuade her that some young
man with a moustache is in love with her.&nbsp; It will be quite
untrue; no young man, with a moustache or without, will ever be
in love with Catherine.&nbsp; But Lavinia will take it up, and
talk to her about it; perhaps, even, if her taste for clandestine
operations doesn&rsquo;t prevail with her, she will talk to me
about it.&nbsp; Catherine won&rsquo;t see it, and won&rsquo;t
believe it, fortunately for her peace of mind; poor Catherine
isn&rsquo;t romantic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was a healthy well-grown child, without a trace of her
mother&rsquo;s beauty.&nbsp; She was not ugly; she had simply a
plain, dull, gentle countenance.&nbsp; The most that had ever
been said for her was that she had a &ldquo;nice&rdquo; face,
and, though she was an heiress, no one had ever thought of
regarding her as a belle.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s opinion of her
moral purity was abundantly justified; she was excellently,
imperturbably good; affectionate, docile, obedient, and much
addicted to speaking the truth.&nbsp; In her younger years she
was a good deal of a romp, and, though it is an awkward
confession to make about one&rsquo;s heroine, I must add that she
was something of a glutton.&nbsp; She never, that I know of,
stole raisins out of the pantry; but she devoted her pocket-money
to the purchase of cream-cakes.&nbsp; As regards this, however, a
critical attitude would be inconsistent with a candid reference
to the early annals of any biographer.&nbsp; Catherine was
decidedly not clever; she was not quick with her book, nor,
indeed, with anything else.&nbsp; She was not abnormally
deficient, and she mustered learning enough to acquit herself
respectably in conversation with her contemporaries, among whom
it must be avowed, however, that she occupied a secondary
place.&nbsp; It is well known that in New York it is possible for
a young girl to occupy a primary one.&nbsp; Catherine, who was
extremely modest, had no desire to shine, and on most social
occasions, as they are called, you would have found her lurking
in the background.&nbsp; She was extremely fond of her father,
and very much afraid of him; she thought him the cleverest and
handsomest and most celebrated of men.&nbsp; The poor girl found
her account so completely in the exercise of her affections that
the little tremor of fear that mixed itself with her filial
passion gave the thing an extra relish rather than blunted its
edge.&nbsp; Her deepest desire was to please him, and her
conception of happiness was to know that she had succeeded in
pleasing him.&nbsp; She had never succeeded beyond a certain
point.&nbsp; Though, on the whole, he was very kind to her, she
was perfectly aware of this, and to go beyond the point in
question seemed to her really something to live for.&nbsp; What
she could not know, of course, was that she disappointed him,
though on three or four occasions the Doctor had been almost
frank about it.&nbsp; She grew up peacefully and prosperously,
but at the age of eighteen Mrs. Penniman had not made a clever
woman of her.&nbsp; Dr. Sloper would have liked to be proud of
his daughter; but there was nothing to be proud of in poor
Catherine.&nbsp; There was nothing, of course, to be ashamed of;
but this was not enough for the Doctor, who was a proud man and
would have enjoyed being able to think of his daughter as an
unusual girl.&nbsp; There would have been a fitness in her being
pretty and graceful, intelligent and distinguished; for her
mother had been the most charming woman of her little day, and as
regards her father, of course he knew his own value.&nbsp; He had
moments of irritation at having produced a commonplace child, and
he even went so far at times as to take a certain satisfaction in
the thought that his wife had not lived to find her out.&nbsp; He
was naturally slow in making this discovery himself, and it was
not till Catherine had become a young lady grown that he regarded
the matter as settled.&nbsp; He gave her the benefit of a great
many doubts; he was in no haste to conclude.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman
frequently assured him that his daughter had a delightful nature;
but he knew how to interpret this assurance.&nbsp; It meant, to
his sense, that Catherine was not wise enough to discover that
her aunt was a goose&mdash;a limitation of mind that could not
fail to be agreeable to Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; Both she and her
brother, however, exaggerated the young girl&rsquo;s limitations;
for Catherine, though she was very fond of her aunt, and
conscious of the gratitude she owed her, regarded her without a
particle of that gentle dread which gave its stamp to her
admiration of her father.&nbsp; To her mind there was nothing of
the infinite about Mrs. Penniman; Catherine saw her all at once,
as it were, and was not dazzled by the apparition; whereas her
father&rsquo;s great faculties seemed, as they stretched away, to
lose themselves in a sort of luminous vagueness, which indicated,
not that they stopped, but that Catherine&rsquo;s own mind ceased
to follow them.</p>
<p>It must not be supposed that Dr. Sloper visited his
disappointment upon the poor girl, or ever let her suspect that
she had played him a trick.&nbsp; On the contrary, for fear of
being unjust to her, he did his duty with exemplary zeal, and
recognised that she was a faithful and affectionate child.&nbsp;
Besides, he was a philosopher; he smoked a good many cigars over
his disappointment, and in the fulness of time he got used to
it.&nbsp; He satisfied himself that he had expected nothing,
though, indeed, with a certain oddity of reasoning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I expect nothing,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;so
that if she gives me a surprise, it will be all clear
again.&nbsp; If she doesn&rsquo;t, it will be no
loss.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was about the time Catherine had reached
her eighteenth year, so that it will be seen her father had not
been precipitate.&nbsp; At this time she seemed not only
incapable of giving surprises; it was almost a question whether
she could have received one&mdash;she was so quiet and
irresponsive.&nbsp; People who expressed themselves roughly
called her stolid.&nbsp; But she was irresponsive because she was
shy, uncomfortably, painfully shy.&nbsp; This was not always
understood, and she sometimes produced an impression of
insensibility.&nbsp; In reality she was the softest creature in
the world.</p>
<h2><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">As</span> a child she had promised to be
tall, but when she was sixteen she ceased to grow, and her
stature, like most other points in her composition, was not
unusual.&nbsp; She was strong, however, and properly made, and,
fortunately, her health was excellent.&nbsp; It has been noted
that the Doctor was a philosopher, but I would not have answered
for his philosophy if the poor girl had proved a sickly and
suffering person.&nbsp; Her appearance of health constituted her
principal claim to beauty, and her clear, fresh complexion, in
which white and red were very equally distributed, was, indeed,
an excellent thing to see.&nbsp; Her eye was small and quiet, her
features were rather thick, her tresses brown and smooth.&nbsp; A
dull, plain girl she was called by rigorous critics&mdash;a
quiet, ladylike girl by those of the more imaginative sort; but
by neither class was she very elaborately discussed.&nbsp; When
it had been duly impressed upon her that she was a young
lady&mdash;it was a good while before she could believe
it&mdash;she suddenly developed a lively taste for dress: a
lively taste is quite the expression to use.&nbsp; I feel as if I
ought to write it very small, her judgement in this matter was by
no means infallible; it was liable to confusions and
embarrassments.&nbsp; Her great indulgence of it was really the
desire of a rather inarticulate nature to manifest itself; she
sought to be eloquent in her garments, and to make up for her
diffidence of speech by a fine frankness of costume.&nbsp; But if
she expressed herself in her clothes it is certain that people
were not to blame for not thinking her a witty person.&nbsp; It
must be added that though she had the expectation of a
fortune&mdash;Dr. Sloper for a long time had been making twenty
thousand dollars a year by his profession, and laying aside the
half of it&mdash;the amount of money at her disposal was not
greater than the allowance made to many poorer girls.&nbsp; In
those days in New York there were still a few altar-fires
flickering in the temple of Republican simplicity, and Dr. Sloper
would have been glad to see his daughter present herself, with a
classic grace, as a priestess of this mild faith.&nbsp; It made
him fairly grimace, in private, to think that a child of his
should be both ugly and overdressed.&nbsp; For himself, he was
fond of the good things of life, and he made a considerable use
of them; but he had a dread of vulgarity, and even a theory that
it was increasing in the society that surrounded him.&nbsp;
Moreover, the standard of luxury in the United States thirty
years ago was carried by no means so high as at present, and
Catherine&rsquo;s clever father took the old-fashioned view of
the education of young persons.&nbsp; He had no particular theory
on the subject; it had scarcely as yet become a necessity of
self-defence to have a collection of theories.&nbsp; It simply
appeared to him proper and reasonable that a well-bred young
woman should not carry half her fortune on her back.&nbsp;
Catherine&rsquo;s back was a broad one, and would have carried a
good deal; but to the weight of the paternal displeasure she
never ventured to expose it, and our heroine was twenty years old
before she treated herself, for evening wear, to a red satin gown
trimmed with gold fringe; though this was an article which, for
many years, she had coveted in secret.&nbsp; It made her look,
when she sported it, like a woman of thirty; but oddly enough, in
spite of her taste for fine clothes, she had not a grain of
coquetry, and her anxiety when she put them on was as to whether
they, and not she, would look well.&nbsp; It is a point on which
history has not been explicit, but the assumption is warrantable;
it was in the royal raiment just mentioned that she presented
herself at a little entertainment given by her aunt, Mrs.
Almond.&nbsp; The girl was at this time in her twenty-first year,
and Mrs. Almond&rsquo;s party was the beginning of something very
important.</p>
<p>Some three or four years before this Dr. Sloper had moved his
household gods up town, as they say in New York.&nbsp; He had
been living ever since his marriage in an edifice of red brick,
with granite copings and an enormous fanlight over the door,
standing in a street within five minutes&rsquo; walk of the City
Hall, which saw its best days (from the social point of view)
about 1820.&nbsp; After this, the tide of fashion began to set
steadily northward, as, indeed, in New York, thanks to the narrow
channel in which it flows, it is obliged to do, and the great hum
of traffic rolled farther to the right and left of
Broadway.&nbsp; By the time the Doctor changed his residence the
murmur of trade had become a mighty uproar, which was music in
the ears of all good citizens interested in the commercial
development, as they delighted to call it, of their fortunate
isle.&nbsp; Dr. Sloper&rsquo;s interest in this phenomenon was
only indirect&mdash;though, seeing that, as the years went on,
half his patients came to be overworked men of business, it might
have been more immediate&mdash;and when most of his
neighbours&rsquo; dwellings (also ornamented with granite copings
and large fanlights) had been converted into offices, warehouses,
and shipping agencies, and otherwise applied to the base uses of
commerce, he determined to look out for a quieter home.&nbsp; The
ideal of quiet and of genteel retirement, in 1835, was found in
Washington Square, where the Doctor built himself a handsome,
modern, wide-fronted house, with a big balcony before the
drawing-room windows, and a flight of marble steps ascending to a
portal which was also faced with white marble.&nbsp; This
structure, and many of its neighbours, which it exactly
resembled, were supposed, forty years ago, to embody the last
results of architectural science, and they remain to this day
very solid and honourable dwellings.&nbsp; In front of them was
the Square, containing a considerable quantity of inexpensive
vegetation, enclosed by a wooden paling, which increased its
rural and accessible appearance; and round the corner was the
more august precinct of the Fifth Avenue, taking its origin at
this point with a spacious and confident air which already marked
it for high destinies.&nbsp; I know not whether it is owing to
the tenderness of early associations, but this portion of New
York appears to many persons the most delectable.&nbsp; It has a
kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in
other quarters of the long, shrill city; it has a riper, richer,
more honourable look than any of the upper ramifications of the
great longitudinal thoroughfare&mdash;the look of having had
something of a social history.&nbsp; It was here, as you might
have been informed on good authority, that you had come into a
world which appeared to offer a variety of sources of interest;
it was here that your grandmother lived, in venerable solitude,
and dispensed a hospitality which commended itself alike to the
infant imagination and the infant palate; it was here that you
took your first walks abroad, following the nursery-maid with
unequal step and sniffing up the strange odour of the
ailantus-trees which at that time formed the principal umbrage of
the Square, and diffused an aroma that you were not yet critical
enough to dislike as it deserved; it was here, finally, that your
first school, kept by a broad-bosomed, broad-based old lady with
a ferule, who was always having tea in a blue cup, with a saucer
that didn&rsquo;t match, enlarged the circle both of your
observations and your sensations.&nbsp; It was here, at any rate,
that my heroine spent many years of her life; which is my excuse
for this topographical parenthesis.</p>
<p>Mrs. Almond lived much farther up town, in an embryonic street
with a high number&mdash;a region where the extension of the city
began to assume a theoretic air, where poplars grew beside the
pavement (when there was one), and mingled their shade with the
steep roofs of desultory Dutch houses, and where pigs and
chickens disported themselves in the gutter.&nbsp; These elements
of rural picturesqueness have now wholly departed from New York
street scenery; but they were to be found within the memory of
middle-aged persons, in quarters which now would blush to be
reminded of them.&nbsp; Catherine had a great many cousins, and
with her Aunt Almond&rsquo;s children, who ended by being nine in
number, she lived on terms of considerable intimacy.&nbsp; When
she was younger they had been rather afraid of her; she was
believed, as the phrase is, to be highly educated, and a person
who lived in the intimacy of their Aunt Penniman had something of
reflected grandeur.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman, among the little
Almonds, was an object of more admiration than sympathy.&nbsp;
Her manners were strange and formidable, and her mourning
robes&mdash;she dressed in black for twenty years after her
husband&rsquo;s death, and then suddenly appeared one morning
with pink roses in her cap&mdash;were complicated in odd,
unexpected places with buckles, bugles, and pins, which
discouraged familiarity.&nbsp; She took children too hard, both
for good and for evil, and had an oppressive air of expecting
subtle things of them, so that going to see her was a good deal
like being taken to church and made to sit in a front pew.&nbsp;
It was discovered after a while, however, that Aunt Penniman was
but an accident in Catherine&rsquo;s existence, and not a part of
its essence, and that when the girl came to spend a Saturday with
her cousins, she was available for
&ldquo;follow-my-master,&rdquo; and even for leapfrog.&nbsp; On
this basis an understanding was easily arrived at, and for
several years Catherine fraternised with her young kinsmen.&nbsp;
I say young kinsmen, because seven of the little Almonds were
boys, and Catherine had a preference for those games which are
most conveniently played in trousers.&nbsp; By degrees, however,
the little Almonds&rsquo; trousers began to lengthen, and the
wearers to disperse and settle themselves in life.&nbsp; The
elder children were older than Catherine, and the boys were sent
to college or placed in counting-rooms.&nbsp; Of the girls, one
married very punctually, and the other as punctually became
engaged.&nbsp; It was to celebrate this latter event that Mrs.
Almond gave the little party I have mentioned.&nbsp; Her daughter
was to marry a stout young stockbroker, a boy of twenty; it was
thought a very good thing.</p>
<h2><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Penniman</span>, with more buckles
and bangles than ever, came, of course, to the entertainment,
accompanied by her niece; the Doctor, too, had promised to look
in later in the evening.&nbsp; There was to be a good deal of
dancing, and before it had gone very far, Marian Almond came up
to Catherine, in company with a tall young man.&nbsp; She
introduced the young man as a person who had a great desire to
make our heroine&rsquo;s acquaintance, and as a cousin of Arthur
Townsend, her own intended.</p>
<p>Marian Almond was a pretty little person of seventeen, with a
very small figure and a very big sash, to the elegance of whose
manners matrimony had nothing to add.&nbsp; She already had all
the airs of a hostess, receiving the company, shaking her fan,
saying that with so many people to attend to she should have no
time to dance.&nbsp; She made a long speech about Mr.
Townsend&rsquo;s cousin, to whom she administered a tap with her
fan before turning away to other cares.&nbsp; Catherine had not
understood all that she said; her attention was given to enjoying
Marian&rsquo;s ease of manner and flow of ideas, and to looking
at the young man, who was remarkably handsome.&nbsp; She had
succeeded, however, as she often failed to do when people were
presented to her, in catching his name, which appeared to be the
same as that of Marian&rsquo;s little stockbroker.&nbsp;
Catherine was always agitated by an introduction; it seemed a
difficult moment, and she wondered that some people&mdash;her new
acquaintance at this moment, for instance&mdash;should mind it so
little.&nbsp; She wondered what she ought to say, and what would
be the consequences of her saying nothing.&nbsp; The consequences
at present were very agreeable.&nbsp; Mr. Townsend, leaving her
no time for embarrassment, began to talk with an easy smile, as
if he had known her for a year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a delightful party!&nbsp; What a charming
house!&nbsp; What an interesting family!&nbsp; What a pretty girl
your cousin is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>These observations, in themselves of no great profundity, Mr.
Townsend seemed to offer for what they were worth, and as a
contribution to an acquaintance.&nbsp; He looked straight into
Catherine&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; She answered nothing; she only
listened, and looked at him; and he, as if he expected no
particular reply, went on to say many other things in the same
comfortable and natural manner.&nbsp; Catherine, though she felt
tongue-tied, was conscious of no embarrassment; it seemed proper
that he should talk, and that she should simply look at
him.&nbsp; What made it natural was that he was so handsome, or
rather, as she phrased it to herself, so beautiful.&nbsp; The
music had been silent for a while, but it suddenly began again;
and then he asked her, with a deeper, intenser smile, if she
would do him the honour of dancing with him.&nbsp; Even to this
inquiry she gave no audible assent; she simply let him put his
arm round her waist&mdash;as she did so it occurred to her more
vividly than it had ever done before, that this was a singular
place for a gentleman&rsquo;s arm to be&mdash;and in a moment he
was guiding her round the room in the harmonious rotation of the
polka.&nbsp; When they paused she felt that she was red; and
then, for some moments, she stopped looking at him.&nbsp; She
fanned herself, and looked at the flowers that were painted on
her fan.&nbsp; He asked her if she would begin again, and she
hesitated to answer, still looking at the flowers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it make you dizzy?&rdquo; he asked, in a tone of
great kindness.</p>
<p>Then Catherine looked up at him; he was certainly beautiful,
and not at all red.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; she hardly
knew why, for dancing had never made her dizzy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well, in that case,&rdquo; said Mr. Townsend,
&ldquo;we will sit still and talk.&nbsp; I will find a good place
to sit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He found a good place&mdash;a charming place; a little sofa
that seemed meant only for two persons.&nbsp; The rooms by this
time were very full; the dancers increased in number, and people
stood close in front of them, turning their backs, so that
Catherine and her companion seemed secluded and unobserved.&nbsp;
&ldquo;<i>We</i> will talk,&rdquo; the young man had said; but he
still did all the talking.&nbsp; Catherine leaned back in her
place, with her eyes fixed upon him, smiling and thinking him
very clever.&nbsp; He had features like young men in pictures;
Catherine had never seen such features&mdash;so delicate, so
chiselled and finished&mdash;among the young New Yorkers whom she
passed in the streets and met at parties.&nbsp; He was tall and
slim, but he looked extremely strong.&nbsp; Catherine thought he
looked like a statue.&nbsp; But a statue would not talk like
that, and, above all, would not have eyes of so rare a
colour.&nbsp; He had never been at Mrs. Almond&rsquo;s before; he
felt very much like a stranger; and it was very kind of Catherine
to take pity on him.&nbsp; He was Arthur Townsend&rsquo;s
cousin&mdash;not very near; several times removed&mdash;and
Arthur had brought him to present him to the family.&nbsp; In
fact, he was a great stranger in New York.&nbsp; It was his
native place; but he had not been there for many years.&nbsp; He
had been knocking about the world, and living in far-away lands;
he had only come back a month or two before.&nbsp; New York was
very pleasant, only he felt lonely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, people forget you,&rdquo; he said, smiling at
Catherine with his delightful gaze, while he leaned forward
obliquely, turning towards her, with his elbows on his knees.</p>
<p>It seemed to Catherine that no one who had once seen him would
ever forget him; but though she made this reflexion she kept it
to herself, almost as you would keep something precious.</p>
<p>They sat there for some time.&nbsp; He was very amusing.&nbsp;
He asked her about the people that were near them; he tried to
guess who some of them were, and he made the most laughable
mistakes.&nbsp; He criticised them very freely, in a positive,
off-hand way.&nbsp; Catherine had never heard any
one&mdash;especially any young man&mdash;talk just like
that.&nbsp; It was the way a young man might talk in a novel; or
better still, in a play, on the stage, close before the
footlights, looking at the audience, and with every one looking
at him, so that you wondered at his presence of mind.&nbsp; And
yet Mr. Townsend was not like an actor; he seemed so sincere, so
natural.&nbsp; This was very interesting; but in the midst of it
Marian Almond came pushing through the crowd, with a little
ironical cry, when she found these young people still together,
which made every one turn round, and cost Catherine a conscious
blush.&nbsp; Marian broke up their talk, and told Mr.
Townsend&mdash;whom she treated as if she were already married,
and he had become her cousin&mdash;to run away to her mother, who
had been wishing for the last half-hour to introduce him to Mr.
Almond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall meet again!&rdquo; he said to Catherine as he
left her, and Catherine thought it a very original speech.</p>
<p>Her cousin took her by the arm, and made her walk about.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I needn&rsquo;t ask you what you think of Morris!&rdquo;
the young girl exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you what you think of his name, but
what you think of himself,&rdquo; said Marian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing particular!&rdquo; Catherine answered,
dissembling for the first time in her life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have half a mind to tell him that!&rdquo; cried
Marian.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will do him good.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s so
terribly conceited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Conceited?&rdquo; said Catherine, staring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Arthur says, and Arthur knows about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell him!&rdquo; Catherine murmured
imploringly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him he&rsquo;s conceited?&nbsp; I have
told him so a dozen times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this profession of audacity Catherine looked down at her
little companion in amazement.&nbsp; She supposed it was because
Marian was going to be married that she took so much on herself;
but she wondered too, whether, when she herself should become
engaged, such exploits would be expected of her.</p>
<p>Half an hour later she saw her Aunt Penniman sitting in the
embrasure of a window, with her head a little on one side, and
her gold eye-glass raised to her eyes, which were wandering about
the room.&nbsp; In front of her was a gentleman, bending forward
a little, with his back turned to Catherine.&nbsp; She knew his
back immediately, though she had never seen it; for when he had
left her, at Marian&rsquo;s instigation, he had retreated in the
best order, without turning round.&nbsp; Morris
Townsend&mdash;the name had already become very familiar to her,
as if some one had been repeating it in her ear for the last
half-hour&mdash;Morris Townsend was giving his impressions of the
company to her aunt, as he had done to herself; he was saying
clever things, and Mrs. Penniman was smiling, as if she approved
of them.&nbsp; As soon as Catherine had perceived this she moved
away; she would not have liked him to turn round and see
her.&nbsp; But it gave her pleasure&mdash;the whole thing.&nbsp;
That he should talk with Mrs. Penniman, with whom she lived and
whom she saw and talked with every day&mdash;that seemed to keep
him near her, and to make him even easier to contemplate than if
she herself had been the object of his civilities; and that Aunt
Lavinia should like him, should not be shocked or startled by
what he said, this also appeared to the girl a personal gain; for
Aunt Lavinia&rsquo;s standard was extremely high, planted as it
was over the grave of her late husband, in which, as she had
convinced every one, the very genius of conversation was
buried.&nbsp; One of the Almond boys, as Catherine called him,
invited our heroine to dance a quadrille, and for a quarter of an
hour her feet at least were occupied.&nbsp; This time she was not
dizzy; her head was very clear.&nbsp; Just when the dance was
over, she found herself in the crowd face to face with her
father.&nbsp; Dr. Sloper had usually a little smile, never a very
big one, and with his little smile playing in his clear eyes and
on his neatly-shaved lips, he looked at his daughter&rsquo;s
crimson gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible that this magnificent person is my
child?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>You would have surprised him if you had told him so; but it is
a literal fact that he almost never addressed his daughter save
in the ironical form.&nbsp; Whenever he addressed her he gave her
pleasure; but she had to cut her pleasure out of the piece, as it
were.&nbsp; There were portions left over, light remnants and
snippets of irony, which she never knew what to do with, which
seemed too delicate for her own use; and yet Catherine, lamenting
the limitations of her understanding, felt that they were too
valuable to waste and had a belief that if they passed over her
head they yet contributed to the general sum of human wisdom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not magnificent,&rdquo; she said mildly, wishing
that she had put on another dress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are sumptuous, opulent, expensive,&rdquo; her
father rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;You look as if you had eighty
thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, so long as I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;&rdquo; said
Catherine illogically.&nbsp; Her conception of her prospective
wealth was as yet very indefinite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So long as you haven&rsquo;t you shouldn&rsquo;t look
as if you had.&nbsp; Have you enjoyed your party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine hesitated a moment; and then, looking away, &ldquo;I
am rather tired,&rdquo; she murmured.&nbsp; I have said that this
entertainment was the beginning of something important for
Catherine.&nbsp; For the second time in her life she made an
indirect answer; and the beginning of a period of dissimulation
is certainly a significant date.&nbsp; Catherine was not so
easily tired as that.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, in the carriage, as they drove home, she was as
quiet as if fatigue had been her portion.&nbsp; Dr.
Sloper&rsquo;s manner of addressing his sister Lavinia had a good
deal of resemblance to the tone he had adopted towards
Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was the young man that was making love to
you?&rdquo; he presently asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my good brother!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Penniman, in
deprecation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seemed uncommonly tender.&nbsp; Whenever I looked at
you, for half an hour, he had the most devoted air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devotion was not to me,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was to Catherine; he talked to me of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine had been listening with all her ears.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Penniman!&rdquo; she exclaimed faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very handsome; he is very clever; he expressed
himself with a great deal&mdash;a great deal of felicity,&rdquo;
her aunt went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is in love with this regal creature, then?&rdquo;
the Doctor inquired humorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; cried the girl, still more faintly,
devoutly thankful the carriage was dark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that; but he admired her
dress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine did not say to herself in the dark, &ldquo;My dress
only?&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s announcement struck her by its
richness, not by its meagreness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said her father, &ldquo;he thinks you
have eighty thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe he thinks of that,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Penniman; &ldquo;he is too refined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be tremendously refined not to think of
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he is!&rdquo; Catherine exclaimed, before she
knew it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought you had gone to sleep,&rdquo; her father
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The hour has come!&rdquo; he added to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lavinia is going to get up a romance for
Catherine.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a shame to play such tricks on the
girl.&nbsp; What is the gentleman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo; he went
on, aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t catch it, and I didn&rsquo;t like to ask
him.&nbsp; He asked to be introduced to me,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman, with a certain grandeur; &ldquo;but you know how
indistinctly Jefferson speaks.&rdquo;&nbsp; Jefferson was Mr.
Almond.&nbsp; &ldquo;Catherine, dear, what was the
gentleman&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a minute, if it had not been for the rumbling of the
carriage, you might have heard a pin drop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Aunt Lavinia,&rdquo; said
Catherine, very softly.&nbsp; And, with all his irony, her father
believed her.</p>
<h2><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>V</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> learned what he had asked some
three or four days later, after Morris Townsend, with his cousin,
had called in Washington Square.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman did not tell
her brother, on the drive home, that she had intimated to this
agreeable young man, whose name she did not know, that, with her
niece, she should be very glad to see him; but she was greatly
pleased, and even a little flattered, when, late on a Sunday
afternoon, the two gentlemen made their appearance.&nbsp; His
coming with Arthur Townsend made it more natural and easy; the
latter young man was on the point of becoming connected with the
family, and Mrs. Penniman had remarked to Catherine that, as he
was going to marry Marian, it would be polite in him to
call.&nbsp; These events came to pass late in the autumn, and
Catherine and her aunt had been sitting together in the closing
dusk, by the firelight, in the high back parlour.</p>
<p>Arthur Townsend fell to Catherine&rsquo;s portion, while his
companion placed himself on the sofa, beside Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp;
Catherine had hitherto not been a harsh critic; she was easy to
please&mdash;she liked to talk with young men.&nbsp; But
Marian&rsquo;s betrothed, this evening, made her feel vaguely
fastidious; he sat looking at the fire and rubbing his knees with
his hands.&nbsp; As for Catherine, she scarcely even pretended to
keep up the conversation; her attention had fixed itself on the
other side of the room; she was listening to what went on between
the other Mr. Townsend and her aunt.&nbsp; Every now and then he
looked over at Catherine herself and smiled, as if to show that
what he said was for her benefit too.&nbsp; Catherine would have
liked to change her place, to go and sit near them, where she
might see and hear him better.&nbsp; But she was afraid of
seeming bold&mdash;of looking eager; and, besides, it would not
have been polite to Marian&rsquo;s little suitor.&nbsp; She
wondered why the other gentleman had picked out her
aunt&mdash;how he came to have so much to say to Mrs. Penniman,
to whom, usually, young men were not especially devoted.&nbsp;
She was not at all jealous of Aunt Lavinia, but she was a little
envious, and above all she wondered; for Morris Townsend was an
object on which she found that her imagination could exercise
itself indefinitely.&nbsp; His cousin had been describing a house
that he had taken in view of his union with Marian, and the
domestic conveniences he meant to introduce into it; how Marian
wanted a larger one, and Mrs. Almond recommended a smaller one,
and how he himself was convinced that he had got the neatest
house in New York.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s only for three or four years.&nbsp; At the end
of three or four years we&rsquo;ll move.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the
way to live in New York&mdash;to move every three or four
years.&nbsp; Then you always get the last thing.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
because the city&rsquo;s growing so quick&mdash;you&rsquo;ve got
to keep up with it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s going straight up
town&mdash;that&rsquo;s where New York&rsquo;s going.&nbsp; If I
wasn&rsquo;t afraid Marian would be lonely, I&rsquo;d go up
there&mdash;right up to the top&mdash;and wait for it.&nbsp; Only
have to wait ten years&mdash;they&rsquo;d all come up after
you.&nbsp; But Marian says she wants some neighbours&mdash;she
doesn&rsquo;t want to be a pioneer.&nbsp; She says that if
she&rsquo;s got to be the first settler she had better go out to
Minnesota.&nbsp; I guess we&rsquo;ll move up little by little;
when we get tired of one street we&rsquo;ll go higher.&nbsp; So
you see we&rsquo;ll always have a new house; it&rsquo;s a great
advantage to have a new house; you get all the latest
improvements.&nbsp; They invent everything all over again about
every five years, and it&rsquo;s a great thing to keep up with
the new things.&nbsp; I always try and keep up with the new
things of every kind.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think that&rsquo;s a
good motto for a young couple&mdash;to keep &lsquo;going
higher&rsquo;?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the name of that piece of
poetry&mdash;what do they call
it?&mdash;<i>Excelsior</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine bestowed on her junior visitor only just enough
attention to feel that this was not the way Mr. Morris Townsend
had talked the other night, or that he was talking now to her
fortunate aunt.&nbsp; But suddenly his aspiring kinsman became
more interesting.&nbsp; He seemed to have become conscious that
she was affected by his companion&rsquo;s presence, and he
thought it proper to explain it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My cousin asked me to bring him, or I shouldn&rsquo;t
have taken the liberty.&nbsp; He seemed to want very much to
come; you know he&rsquo;s awfully sociable.&nbsp; I told him I
wanted to ask you first, but he said Mrs. Penniman had invited
him.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t particular what he says when he wants
to come somewhere!&nbsp; But Mrs. Penniman seems to think
it&rsquo;s all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very glad to see him,&rdquo; said
Catherine.&nbsp; And she wished to talk more about him; but she
hardly knew what to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never saw him
before,&rdquo; she went on presently.</p>
<p>Arthur Townsend stared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, he told me he talked with you for over half an
hour the other night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean before the other night.&nbsp; That was the first
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he has been away from New York&mdash;he has been
all round the world.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t know many people
here, but he&rsquo;s very sociable, and he wants to know every
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one?&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean all the good ones.&nbsp; All the pretty
young ladies&mdash;like Mrs. Penniman!&rdquo; and Arthur Townsend
gave a private laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My aunt likes him very much,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most people like him&mdash;he&rsquo;s so
brilliant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s more like a foreigner,&rdquo; Catherine
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I never knew a foreigner!&rdquo; said young
Townsend, in a tone which seemed to indicate that his ignorance
had been optional.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither have I,&rdquo; Catherine confessed, with more
humility.&nbsp; &ldquo;They say they are generally
brilliant,&rdquo; she added vaguely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the people of this city are clever enough for
me.&nbsp; I know some of them that think they are too clever for
me; but they ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you can&rsquo;t be too clever,&rdquo; said
Catherine, still with humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; I know some people that call
my cousin too clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine listened to this statement with extreme interest,
and a feeling that if Morris Townsend had a fault it would
naturally be that one.&nbsp; But she did not commit herself, and
in a moment she asked: &ldquo;Now that he has come back, will he
stay here always?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Arthur, &ldquo;if he can get something
to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some place or other; some business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t he got any?&rdquo; said Catherine, who had
never heard of a young man&mdash;of the upper class&mdash;in this
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; he&rsquo;s looking round.&nbsp; But he can&rsquo;t
find anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very sorry,&rdquo; Catherine permitted herself to
observe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he doesn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo; said young
Townsend.&nbsp; &ldquo;He takes it easy&mdash;he isn&rsquo;t in a
hurry.&nbsp; He is very particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine thought he naturally would be, and gave herself up
for some moments to the contemplation of this idea, in several of
its bearings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t his father take him into his
business&mdash;his office?&rdquo; she at last inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got any father&mdash;he has only got a
sister.&nbsp; Your sister can&rsquo;t help you much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to Catherine that if she were his sister she would
disprove this axiom.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is she&mdash;is she
pleasant?&rdquo; she asked in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;I believe she&rsquo;s very
respectable,&rdquo; said young Townsend.&nbsp; And then he looked
across to his cousin and began to laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look here,
we are talking about you,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>Morris Townsend paused in his conversation with Mrs. Penniman,
and stared, with a little smile.&nbsp; Then he got up, as if he
were going.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as you are concerned, I can&rsquo;t return the
compliment,&rdquo; he said to Catherine&rsquo;s companion.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But as regards Miss Sloper, it&rsquo;s another
affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine thought this little speech wonderfully well turned;
but she was embarrassed by it, and she also got up.&nbsp; Morris
Townsend stood looking at her and smiling; he put out his hand
for farewell.&nbsp; He was going, without having said anything to
her; but even on these terms she was glad to have seen him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell her what you have said&mdash;when you
go!&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, with an insinuating laugh.</p>
<p>Catherine blushed, for she felt almost as if they were making
sport of her.&nbsp; What in the world could this beautiful young
man have said?&nbsp; He looked at her still, in spite of her
blush; but very kindly and respectfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had no talk with you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
that was what I came for.&nbsp; But it will be a good reason for
coming another time; a little pretext&mdash;if I am obliged to
give one.&nbsp; I am not afraid of what your aunt will say when I
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this the two young men took their departure; after which
Catherine, with her blush still lingering, directed a serious and
interrogative eye to Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; She was incapable of
elaborate artifice, and she resorted to no jocular
device&mdash;to no affectation of the belief that she had been
maligned&mdash;to learn what she desired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you say you would tell me?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman came up to her, smiling and nodding a little,
looked at her all over, and gave a twist to the knot of ribbon in
her neck.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great secret, my dear child;
but he is coming a-courting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine was serious still.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is that what he told
you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say so exactly.&nbsp; But he left me to
guess it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a good guesser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean a-courting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not me, certainly, miss; though I must say he is a
hundred times more polite to a person who has no longer extreme
youth to recommend her than most of the young men.&nbsp; He is
thinking of some one else.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Penniman gave
her niece a delicate little kiss.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must be very
gracious to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine stared&mdash;she was bewildered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t understand you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;he
doesn&rsquo;t know me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, he does; more than you think.&nbsp; I have told
him all about you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Penniman!&rdquo; murmured Catherine, as if
this had been a breach of trust.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is a perfect
stranger&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know him.&rdquo;&nbsp; There was
infinite, modesty in the poor girl&rsquo;s &ldquo;we.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Penniman, however, took no account of it; she spoke even
with a touch of acrimony.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear Catherine, you
know very well that you admire him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Penniman!&rdquo; Catherine could only murmur
again.&nbsp; It might very well be that she admired
him&mdash;though this did not seem to her a thing to talk
about.&nbsp; But that this brilliant stranger&mdash;this sudden
apparition, who had barely heard the sound of her
voice&mdash;took that sort of interest in her that was expressed
by the romantic phrase of which Mrs. Penniman had just made use:
this could only be a figment of the restless brain of Aunt
Lavinia, whom every one knew to be a woman of powerful
imagination.</p>
<h2><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>VI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Penniman</span> even took for granted
at times that other people had as much imagination as herself; so
that when, half an hour later, her brother came in, she addressed
him quite on this principle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has just been here, Austin; it&rsquo;s such a pity
you missed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whom in the world have I missed?&rdquo; asked the
Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morris Townsend; he has made us such a delightful
visit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who in the world is Mr. Morris Townsend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Penniman means the gentleman&mdash;the gentleman
whose name I couldn&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gentleman at Elizabeth&rsquo;s party who was so
struck with Catherine,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, his name is Morris Townsend, is it?&nbsp; And did
he come here to propose to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father,&rdquo; murmured the girl for all answer,
turning away to the window, where the dusk had deepened to
darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he won&rsquo;t do that without your
permission,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, very graciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, my dear, he seems to have yours,&rdquo; her
brother answered.</p>
<p>Lavinia simpered, as if this might not be quite enough, and
Catherine, with her forehead touching the window-panes, listened
to this exchange of epigrams as reservedly as if they had not
each been a pin-prick in her own destiny.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The next time he comes,&rdquo; the Doctor added,
&ldquo;you had better call me.&nbsp; He might like to see
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris Townsend came again, some five days afterwards; but Dr.
Sloper was not called, as he was absent from home at the
time.&nbsp; Catherine was with her aunt when the young
man&rsquo;s name was brought in, and Mrs. Penniman, effacing
herself and protesting, made a great point of her niece&rsquo;s
going into the drawing-room alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This time it&rsquo;s for you&mdash;for you only,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Before, when he talked to me, it was only
preliminary&mdash;it was to gain my confidence.&nbsp; Literally,
my dear, I should not have the <i>courage</i> to show myself
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And this was perfectly true.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman was not a
brave woman, and Morris Townsend had struck her as a young man of
great force of character, and of remarkable powers of satire; a
keen, resolute, brilliant nature, with which one must exercise a
great deal of tact.&nbsp; She said to herself that he was
&ldquo;imperious,&rdquo; and she liked the word and the
idea.&nbsp; She was not the least jealous of her niece, and she
had been perfectly happy with Mr. Penniman, but in the bottom of
her heart she permitted herself the observation:
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the sort of husband I should have
had!&rdquo;&nbsp; He was certainly much more imperious&mdash;she
ended by calling it imperial&mdash;than Mr. Penniman.</p>
<p>So Catherine saw Mr. Townsend alone, and her aunt did not come
in even at the end of the visit.&nbsp; The visit was a long one;
he sat there&mdash;in the front parlour, in the biggest
armchair&mdash;for more than an hour.&nbsp; He seemed more at
home this time&mdash;more familiar; lounging a little in the
chair, slapping a cushion that was near him with his stick, and
looking round the room a good deal, and at the objects it
contained, as well as at Catherine; whom, however, he also
contemplated freely.&nbsp; There was a smile of respectful
devotion in his handsome eyes which seemed to Catherine almost
solemnly beautiful; it made her think of a young knight in a
poem.&nbsp; His talk, however, was not particularly knightly; it
was light and easy and friendly; it took a practical turn, and he
asked a number of questions about herself&mdash;what were her
tastes&mdash;if she liked this and that&mdash;what were her
habits.&nbsp; He said to her, with his charming smile,
&ldquo;Tell me about yourself; give me a little
sketch.&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine had very little to tell, and she
had no talent for sketching; but before he went she had confided
to him that she had a secret passion for the theatre, which had
been but scantily gratified, and a taste for operatic
music&mdash;that of Bellini and Donizetti, in especial (it must
be remembered in extenuation of this primitive young woman that
she held these opinions in an age of general
darkness)&mdash;which she rarely had an occasion to hear, except
on the hand-organ.&nbsp; She confessed that she was not
particularly fond of literature.&nbsp; Morris Townsend agreed
with her that books were tiresome things; only, as he said, you
had to read a good many before you found it out.&nbsp; He had
been to places that people had written books about, and they were
not a bit like the descriptions.&nbsp; To see for
yourself&mdash;that was the great thing; he always tried to see
for himself.&nbsp; He had seen all the principal actors&mdash;he
had been to all the best theatres in London and Paris.&nbsp; But
the actors were always like the authors&mdash;they always
exaggerated.&nbsp; He liked everything to be natural.&nbsp;
Suddenly he stopped, looking at Catherine with his smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I like you for; you are so
natural!&nbsp; Excuse me,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;you see I am
natural myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And before she had time to think whether she excused him or
not&mdash;which afterwards, at leisure, she became conscious that
she did&mdash;he began to talk about music, and to say that it
was his greatest pleasure in life.&nbsp; He had heard all the
great singers in Paris and London&mdash;Pasta and Rubini and
Lablache&mdash;and when you had done that, you could say that you
knew what singing was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I sing a little myself,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;some day
I will show you.&nbsp; Not to-day, but some other
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he got up to go; he had omitted, by accident, to say
that he would sing to her if she would play to him.&nbsp; He
thought of this after he got into the street; but he might have
spared his compunction, for Catherine had not noticed the
lapse.&nbsp; She was thinking only that &ldquo;some other
time&rdquo; had a delightful sound; it seemed to spread itself
over the future.</p>
<p>This was all the more reason, however, though she was ashamed
and uncomfortable, why she should tell her father that Mr. Morris
Townsend had called again.&nbsp; She announced the fact abruptly,
almost violently, as soon as the Doctor came into the house; and
having done so&mdash;it was her duty&mdash;she took measures to
leave the room.&nbsp; But she could not leave it fast enough; her
father stopped her just as she reached the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, did he propose to you to-day?&rdquo; the
Doctor asked.</p>
<p>This was just what she had been afraid he would say; and yet
she had no answer ready.&nbsp; Of course she would have liked to
take it as a joke&mdash;as her father must have meant it; and yet
she would have liked, also, in denying it, to be a little
positive, a little sharp; so that he would perhaps not ask the
question again.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t like it&mdash;it made her
unhappy.&nbsp; But Catherine could never be sharp; and for a
moment she only stood, with her hand on the door-knob, looking at
her satiric parent, and giving a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decidedly,&rdquo; said the Doctor to himself, &ldquo;my
daughter is not brilliant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he had no sooner made this reflexion than Catherine found
something; she had decided, on the whole, to take the thing as a
joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he will do it the next time!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, with a repetition of her laugh.&nbsp; And she quickly
got out of the room.</p>
<p>The Doctor stood staring; he wondered whether his daughter
were serious.&nbsp; Catherine went straight to her own room, and
by the time she reached it she bethought herself that there was
something else&mdash;something better&mdash;she might have
said.&nbsp; She almost wished, now, that her father would ask his
question again, so that she might reply: &ldquo;Oh yes, Mr.
Morris Townsend proposed to me, and I refused him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor, however, began to put his questions elsewhere; it
naturally having occurred to him that he ought to inform himself
properly about this handsome young man who had formed the habit
of running in and out of his house.&nbsp; He addressed himself to
the younger of his sisters, Mrs. Almond&mdash;not going to her
for the purpose; there was no such hurry as that&mdash;but having
made a note of the matter for the first opportunity.&nbsp; The
Doctor was never eager, never impatient nor nervous; but he made
notes of everything, and he regularly consulted his notes.&nbsp;
Among them the information he obtained from Mrs. Almond about
Morris Townsend took its place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lavinia has already been to ask me,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Lavinia is most excited; I don&rsquo;t
understand it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not, after all, Lavinia that the
young man is supposed to have designs upon.&nbsp; She is very
peculiar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my dear,&rdquo; the Doctor replied, &ldquo;she has
not lived with me these twelve years without my finding it
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has got such an artificial mind,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Almond, who always enjoyed an opportunity to discuss
Lavinia&rsquo;s peculiarities with her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;She
didn&rsquo;t want me to tell you that she had asked me about Mr.
Townsend; but I told her I would.&nbsp; She always wants to
conceal everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet at moments no one blurts things out with such
crudity.&nbsp; She is like a revolving lighthouse; pitch darkness
alternating with a dazzling brilliancy!&nbsp; But what did you
tell her?&rdquo; the Doctor asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I tell you; that I know very little of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lavinia must have been disappointed at that,&rdquo;
said the Doctor; &ldquo;she would prefer him to have been guilty
of some romantic crime.&nbsp; However, we must make the best of
people.&nbsp; They tell me our gentleman is the cousin of the
little boy to whom you are about to entrust the future of your
little girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arthur is not a little boy; he is a very old man; you
and I will never be so old.&nbsp; He is a distant relation of
Lavinia&rsquo;s <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.&nbsp; The name is
the same, but I am given to understand that there are Townsends
and Townsends.&nbsp; So Arthur&rsquo;s mother tells me; she
talked about &lsquo;branches&rsquo;&mdash;younger branches, elder
branches, inferior branches&mdash;as if it were a royal
house.&nbsp; Arthur, it appears, is of the reigning line, but
poor Lavinia&rsquo;s young man is not.&nbsp; Beyond this,
Arthur&rsquo;s mother knows very little about him; she has only a
vague story that he has been &lsquo;wild.&rsquo;&nbsp; But I know
his sister a little, and she is a very nice woman.&nbsp; Her name
is Mrs. Montgomery; she is a widow, with a little property and
five children.&nbsp; She lives in the Second Avenue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does Mrs. Montgomery say about him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That he has talents by which he might distinguish
himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only he is lazy, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s family pride,&rdquo; said the
Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is his profession?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got any; he is looking for
something.&nbsp; I believe he was once in the Navy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once?&nbsp; What is his age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose he is upwards of thirty.&nbsp; He must have
gone into the Navy very young.&nbsp; I think Arthur told me that
he inherited a small property&mdash;which was perhaps the cause
of his leaving the Navy&mdash;and that he spent it all in a few
years.&nbsp; He travelled all over the world, lived abroad,
amused himself.&nbsp; I believe it was a kind of system, a theory
he had.&nbsp; He has lately come back to America, with the
intention, as he tells Arthur, of beginning life in
earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he in earnest about Catherine, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should be incredulous,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Almond.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me that you have never
done Catherine justice.&nbsp; You must remember that she has the
prospect of thirty thousand a year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at his sister a moment, and then, with the
slightest touch of bitterness: &ldquo;You at least appreciate
her,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Almond blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean that is her only merit; I simply
mean that it is a great one.&nbsp; A great many young men think
so; and you appear to me never to have been properly aware of
that.&nbsp; You have always had a little way of alluding to her
as an unmarriageable girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My allusions are as kind as yours, Elizabeth,&rdquo;
said the Doctor frankly.&nbsp; &ldquo;How many suitors has
Catherine had, with all her expectations&mdash;how much attention
has she ever received?&nbsp; Catherine is not unmarriageable, but
she is absolutely unattractive.&nbsp; What other reason is there
for Lavinia being so charmed with the idea that there is a lover
in the house?&nbsp; There has never been one before, and Lavinia,
with her sensitive, sympathetic nature, is not used to the
idea.&nbsp; It affects her imagination.&nbsp; I must do the young
men of New York the justice to say that they strike me as very
disinterested.&nbsp; They prefer pretty girls&mdash;lively
girls&mdash;girls like your own.&nbsp; Catherine is neither
pretty nor lively.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catherine does very well; she has a style of her
own&mdash;which is more than my poor Marian has, who has no style
at all,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond.&nbsp; &ldquo;The reason
Catherine has received so little attention is that she seems to
all the young men to be older than themselves.&nbsp; She is so
large, and she dresses&mdash;so richly.&nbsp; They are rather
afraid of her, I think; she looks as if she had been married
already, and you know they don&rsquo;t like married women.&nbsp;
And if our young men appear disinterested,&rdquo; the
Doctor&rsquo;s wiser sister went on, &ldquo;it is because they
marry, as a general thing, so young; before twenty-five, at the
age of innocence and sincerity, before the age of
calculation.&nbsp; If they only waited a little, Catherine would
fare better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a calculation?&nbsp; Thank you very much,&rdquo;
said the Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till some intelligent man of forty comes along,
and he will be delighted with Catherine,&rdquo; Mrs. Almond
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Townsend is not old enough, then; his motives may
be pure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very possible that his motives are pure; I should
be very sorry to take the contrary for granted.&nbsp; Lavinia is
sure of it, and, as he is a very prepossessing youth, you might
give him the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Sloper reflected a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are his present means of subsistence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no idea.&nbsp; He lives, as I say, with his
sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A widow, with five children?&nbsp; Do you mean he lives
<i>upon</i> her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Almond got up, and with a certain impatience: &ldquo;Had
you not better ask Mrs. Montgomery herself?&rdquo; she
inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I may come to that,&rdquo; said the
Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you say the Second Avenue?&rdquo;&nbsp;
He made a note of the Second Avenue.</p>
<h2><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>VII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> was, however, by no means so
much in earnest as this might seem to indicate; and, indeed, he
was more than anything else amused with the whole
situation.&nbsp; He was not in the least in a state of tension or
of vigilance with regard to Catherine&rsquo;s prospects he was
even on his guard against the ridicule that might attach itself
to the spectacle of a house thrown into agitation by its daughter
and heiress receiving attentions unprecedented in its
annals.&nbsp; More than this, he went so far as to promise
himself some entertainment from the little drama&mdash;if drama
it was&mdash;of which Mrs. Penniman desired to represent the
ingenious Mr. Townsend as the hero.&nbsp; He had no intention, as
yet, of regulating the <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.&nbsp; He was
perfectly willing, as Elizabeth had suggested, to give the young
man the benefit of every doubt.&nbsp; There was no great danger
in it; for Catherine, at the age of twenty-two, was, after all, a
rather mature blossom, such as could be plucked from the stem
only by a vigorous jerk.&nbsp; The fact that Morris Townsend was
poor&mdash;was not of necessity against him; the Doctor had never
made up his mind that his daughter should marry a rich man.&nbsp;
The fortune she would inherit struck him as a very sufficient
provision for two reasonable persons, and if a penniless swain
who could give a good account of himself should enter the lists,
he should be judged quite upon his personal merits.&nbsp; There
were other things besides.&nbsp; The Doctor thought it very
vulgar to be precipitate in accusing people of mercenary motives,
inasmuch as his door had as yet not been in the least besieged by
fortune-hunters; and, lastly, he was very curious to see whether
Catherine might really be loved for her moral worth.&nbsp; He
smiled as he reflected that poor Mr. Townsend had been only twice
to the house, and he said to Mrs. Penniman that the next time he
should come she must ask him to dinner.</p>
<p>He came very soon again, and Mrs. Penniman had of course great
pleasure in executing this mission.&nbsp; Morris Townsend
accepted her invitation with equal good grace, and the dinner
took place a few days later.&nbsp; The Doctor had said to
himself, justly enough, that they must not have the young man
alone; this would partake too much of the nature of
encouragement.&nbsp; So two or three other persons were invited;
but Morris Townsend, though he was by no means the ostensible,
was the real, occasion of the feast.&nbsp; There is every reason
to suppose that he desired to make a good impression; and if he
fell short of this result, it was not for want of a good deal of
intelligent effort.&nbsp; The Doctor talked to him very little
during dinner; but he observed him attentively, and after the
ladies had gone out he pushed him the wine and asked him several
questions.&nbsp; Morris was not a young man who needed to be
pressed, and he found quite enough encouragement in the superior
quality of the claret.&nbsp; The Doctor&rsquo;s wine was
admirable, and it may be communicated to the reader that while he
sipped it Morris reflected that a cellar-full of good
liquor&mdash;there was evidently a cellar-full here&mdash;would
be a most attractive idiosyncrasy in a father-in-law.&nbsp; The
Doctor was struck with his appreciative guest; he saw that he was
not a commonplace young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has ability,&rdquo;
said Catherine&rsquo;s father, &ldquo;decided ability; he has a
very good head if he chooses to use it.&nbsp; And he is
uncommonly well turned out; quite the sort of figure that pleases
the ladies.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think I like
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Doctor, however, kept his reflexions to
himself, and talked to his visitors about foreign lands,
concerning which Morris offered him more information than he was
ready, as he mentally phrased it, to swallow.&nbsp; Dr. Sloper
had travelled but little, and he took the liberty of not
believing everything this anecdotical idler narrated.&nbsp; He
prided himself on being something of a physiognomist, and while
the young man, chatting with easy assurance, puffed his cigar and
filled his glass again, the Doctor sat with his eyes quietly
fixed on his bright, expressive face.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has the
assurance of the devil himself,&rdquo; said Morris&rsquo;s host;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw such assurance.&nbsp; And
his powers of invention are most remarkable.&nbsp; He is very
knowing; they were not so knowing as that in my time.&nbsp; And a
good head, did I say?&nbsp; I should think so&mdash;after a
bottle of Madeira and a bottle and a half of claret!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After dinner Morris Townsend went and stood before Catherine,
who was standing before the fire in her red satin gown.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like me&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t like me
at all!&rdquo; said the young man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who doesn&rsquo;t like you?&rdquo; asked Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father; extraordinary man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how you know,&rdquo; said Catherine,
blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel; I am very quick to feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you are mistaken.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well; you ask him and you will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather not ask him, if there is any danger of
his saying what you think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris looked at her with an air of mock melancholy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t give you any pleasure to contradict
him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never contradict him,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you hear me abused without opening your lips in my
defence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father won&rsquo;t abuse you.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t
know you enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris Townsend gave a loud laugh, and Catherine began to
blush again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never mention you,&rdquo; she said, to take
refuge from her confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is very well; but it is not quite what I should
have liked you to say.&nbsp; I should have liked you to say:
&lsquo;If my father doesn&rsquo;t think well of you, what does it
matter?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but it would matter; I couldn&rsquo;t say
that!&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.</p>
<p>He looked at her for a moment, smiling a little; and the
Doctor, if he had been watching him just then, would have seen a
gleam of fine impatience in the sociable softness of his
eye.&nbsp; But there was no impatience in his
rejoinder&mdash;none, at least, save what was expressed in a
little appealing sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, well, then, I must not
give up the hope of bringing him round!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He expressed it more frankly to Mrs. Penniman later in the
evening.&nbsp; But before that he sang two or three songs at
Catherine&rsquo;s timid request; not that he flattered himself
that this would help to bring her father round.&nbsp; He had a
sweet, light tenor voice, and when he had finished every one made
some exclamation&mdash;every one, that is, save Catherine, who
remained intensely silent.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman declared that his
manner of singing was &ldquo;most artistic,&rdquo; and Dr. Sloper
said it was &ldquo;very taking&mdash;very taking indeed&rdquo;;
speaking loudly and distinctly, but with a certain dryness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t like me&mdash;he doesn&rsquo;t like me
at all,&rdquo; said Morris Townsend, addressing the aunt in the
same manner as he had done the niece.&nbsp; &ldquo;He thinks
I&rsquo;m all wrong.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unlike her niece, Mrs. Penniman asked for no
explanation.&nbsp; She only smiled very sweetly, as if she
understood everything; and, unlike Catherine too, she made no
attempt to contradict him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pray, what does it
matter?&rdquo; she murmured softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you say the right thing!&rdquo; said Morris,
greatly to the gratification of Mrs. Penniman, who prided herself
on always saying the right thing.</p>
<p>The Doctor, the next time he saw his sister Elizabeth, let her
know that he had made the acquaintance of Lavinia&rsquo;s
<i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Physically,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
uncommonly well set up.&nbsp; As an anatomist, it is really a
pleasure to me to see such a beautiful structure; although, if
people were all like him, I suppose there would be very little
need for doctors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see anything in people but their
bones?&rdquo; Mrs. Almond rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you
think of him as a father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a father?&nbsp; Thank Heaven I am not his
father!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but you are Catherine&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Lavinia tells
me she is in love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She must get over it.&nbsp; He is not a
gentleman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, take care!&nbsp; Remember that he is a branch of
the Townsends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not what I call a gentleman.&nbsp; He has not the
soul of one.&nbsp; He is extremely insinuating; but it&rsquo;s a
vulgar nature.&nbsp; I saw through it in a minute.&nbsp; He is
altogether too familiar&mdash;I hate familiarity.&nbsp; He is a
plausible coxcomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond; &ldquo;if you make
up your mind so easily, it&rsquo;s a great advantage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t make up my mind easily.&nbsp; What I tell
you is the result of thirty years of observation; and in order to
be able to form that judgement in a single evening, I have had to
spend a lifetime in study.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very possibly you are right.&nbsp; But the thing is for
Catherine to see it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will present her with a pair of spectacles!&rdquo;
said the Doctor.</p>
<h2><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> it were true that she was in
love, she was certainly very quiet about it; but the Doctor was
of course prepared to admit that her quietness might mean
volumes.&nbsp; She had told Morris Townsend that she would not
mention him to her father, and she saw no reason to retract this
vow of discretion.&nbsp; It was no more than decently civil, of
course, that after having dined in Washington Square, Morris
should call there again; and it was no more than natural that,
having been kindly received on this occasion, he should continue
to present himself.&nbsp; He had had plenty of leisure on his
hands; and thirty years ago, in New York, a young man of leisure
had reason to be thankful for aids to self-oblivion.&nbsp;
Catherine said nothing to her father about these visits, though
they had rapidly become the most important, the most absorbing
thing in her life.&nbsp; The girl was very happy.&nbsp; She knew
not as yet what would come of it; but the present had suddenly
grown rich and solemn.&nbsp; If she had been told she was in
love, she would have been a good deal surprised; for she had an
idea that love was an eager and exacting passion, and her own
heart was filled in these days with the impulse of
self-effacement and sacrifice.&nbsp; Whenever Morris Townsend had
left the house, her imagination projected itself, with all its
strength, into the idea of his soon coming back; but if she had
been told at such a moment that he would not return for a year,
or even that he would never return, she would not have complained
nor rebelled, but would have humbly accepted the decree, and
sought for consolation in thinking over the times she had already
seen him, the words he had spoken, the sound of his voice, of his
tread, the expression of his face.&nbsp; Love demands certain
things as a right; but Catherine had no sense of her rights; she
had only a consciousness of immense and unexpected favours.&nbsp;
Her very gratitude for these things had hushed itself; for it
seemed to her that there would be something of impudence in
making a festival of her secret.&nbsp; Her father suspected
Morris Townsend&rsquo;s visits, and noted her reserve.&nbsp; She
seemed to beg pardon for it; she looked at him constantly in
silence, as if she meant to say that she said nothing because she
was afraid of irritating him.&nbsp; But the poor girl&rsquo;s
dumb eloquence irritated him more than anything else would have
done, and he caught himself murmuring more than once that it was
a grievous pity his only child was a simpleton.&nbsp; His
murmurs, however, were inaudible; and for a while he said nothing
to any one.&nbsp; He would have liked to know exactly how often
young Townsend came; but he had determined to ask no questions of
the girl herself&mdash;to say nothing more to her that would show
that he watched her.&nbsp; The Doctor had a great idea of being
largely just: he wished to leave his daughter her liberty, and
interfere only when the danger should be proved.&nbsp; It was not
in his manner to obtain information by indirect methods, and it
never even occurred to him to question the servants.&nbsp; As for
Lavinia, he hated to talk to her about the matter; she annoyed
him with her mock romanticism.&nbsp; But he had to come to
this.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s convictions as regards the
relations of her niece and the clever young visitor who saved
appearances by coming ostensibly for both the ladies&mdash;Mrs.
Penniman&rsquo;s convictions had passed into a riper and richer
phase.&nbsp; There was to be no crudity in Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s
treatment of the situation; she had become as uncommunicative as
Catherine herself.&nbsp; She was tasting of the sweets of
concealment; she had taken up the line of mystery.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She would be enchanted to be able to prove to herself that
she is persecuted,&rdquo; said the Doctor; and when at last he
questioned her, he was sure she would contrive to extract from
his words a pretext for this belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be so good as to let me know what is going on in the
house,&rdquo; he said to her, in a tone which, under the
circumstances, he himself deemed genial.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Going on, Austin?&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, I am sure I don&rsquo;t know!&nbsp; I believe that
last night the old grey cat had kittens!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At her age?&rdquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
idea is startling&mdash;almost shocking.&nbsp; Be so good as to
see that they are all drowned.&nbsp; But what else has
happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, the dear little kittens!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have them drowned for the
world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her brother puffed his cigar a few moments in silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your sympathy with kittens, Lavinia,&rdquo; he presently
resumed, &ldquo;arises from a feline element in your own
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cats are very graceful, and very clean,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Penniman, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very stealthy.&nbsp; You are the embodiment both of
grace and of neatness; but you are wanting in
frankness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly are not, dear brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t pretend to be graceful, though I try to
be neat.&nbsp; Why haven&rsquo;t you let me know that Mr. Morris
Townsend is coming to the house four times a week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman lifted her eyebrows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Four times a
week?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Five times, if you prefer it.&nbsp; I am away all day,
and I see nothing.&nbsp; But when such things happen, you should
let me know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, with her eyebrows still raised, reflected
intently.&nbsp; &ldquo;Dear Austin,&rdquo; she said at last,
&ldquo;I am incapable of betraying a confidence.&nbsp; I would
rather suffer anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never fear; you shall not suffer.&nbsp; To whose
confidence is it you allude?&nbsp; Has Catherine made you take a
vow of eternal secrecy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means.&nbsp; Catherine has not told me as much as
she might.&nbsp; She has not been very trustful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the young man, then, who has made you his
confidante?&nbsp; Allow me to say that it is extremely indiscreet
of you to form secret alliances with young men.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t know where they may lead you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by an alliance,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I take a great interest in Mr.
Townsend; I won&rsquo;t conceal that.&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under the circumstances, that is quite enough.&nbsp;
What is the source of your interest in Mr. Townsend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, musing, and then
breaking into her smile, &ldquo;that he is so
interesting!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor felt that he had need of his patience.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what makes him interesting?&mdash;his good
looks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His misfortunes, Austin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he has had misfortunes?&nbsp; That, of course, is
always interesting.&nbsp; Are you at liberty to mention a few of
Mr. Townsend&rsquo;s?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that he would like it,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has told me a great deal about
himself&mdash;he has told me, in fact, his whole history.&nbsp;
But I don&rsquo;t think I ought to repeat those things.&nbsp; He
would tell them to you, I am sure, if he thought you would listen
to him kindly.&nbsp; With kindness you may do anything with
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor gave a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall request him very
kindly, then, to leave Catherine alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, shaking her forefinger
at her brother, with her little finger turned out,
&ldquo;Catherine had probably said something to him kinder than
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Said that she loved him?&nbsp; Do you mean
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman fixed her eyes on the floor.&nbsp; &ldquo;As I
tell you, Austin, she doesn&rsquo;t confide in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have an opinion, I suppose, all the same.&nbsp; It
is that I ask you for; though I don&rsquo;t conceal from you that
I shall not regard it as conclusive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s gaze continued to rest on the carpet;
but at last she lifted it, and then her brother thought it very
expressive.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think Catherine is very happy; that is
all I can say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Townsend is trying to marry her&mdash;is that what you
mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is greatly interested in her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He finds her such an attractive girl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catherine has a lovely nature, Austin,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman, &ldquo;and Mr. Townsend has had the intelligence to
discover that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With a little help from you, I suppose.&nbsp; My dear
Lavinia,&rdquo; cried the Doctor, &ldquo;you are an admirable
aunt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So Mr. Townsend says,&rdquo; observed Lavinia,
smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he is sincere?&rdquo; asked her
brother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In saying that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; that&rsquo;s of course.&nbsp; But in his admiration
for Catherine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deeply sincere.&nbsp; He has said to me the most
appreciative, the most charming things about her.&nbsp; He would
say them to you, if he were sure you would listen to
him&mdash;gently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doubt whether I can undertake it.&nbsp; He appears to
require a great deal of gentleness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a sympathetic, sensitive nature,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman.</p>
<p>Her brother puffed his cigar again in silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;These delicate qualities have survived his vicissitudes,
eh?&nbsp; All this while you haven&rsquo;t told me about his
misfortunes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a long story,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman,
&ldquo;and I regard it as a sacred trust.&nbsp; But I suppose
there is no objection to my saying that he has been wild&mdash;he
frankly confesses that.&nbsp; But he has paid for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what has impoverished him, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean simply in money.&nbsp; He is very
much alone in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that he has behaved so badly that his
friends have given him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has had false friends, who have deceived and
betrayed him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He seems to have some good ones too.&nbsp; He has a
devoted sister, and half-a-dozen nephews and nieces.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was silent a minute.&nbsp; &ldquo;The nephews
and nieces are children, and the sister is not a very attractive
person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he doesn&rsquo;t abuse her to you,&rdquo; said
the Doctor; &ldquo;for I am told he lives upon her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lives upon her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lives with her, and does nothing for himself; it is
about the same thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is looking for a position&mdash;most
earnestly,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;He hopes every
day to find one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; He is looking for it here&mdash;over
there in the front parlour.&nbsp; The position of husband of a
weak-minded woman with a large fortune would suit him to
perfection!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was truly amiable, but she now gave signs of
temper.&nbsp; She rose with much animation, and stood for a
moment looking at her brother.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear
Austin,&rdquo; she remarked, &ldquo;if you regard Catherine as a
weak-minded woman, you are particularly mistaken!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And with this she moved majestically away.</p>
<h2><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was a regular custom with the
family in Washington Square to go and spend Sunday evening at
Mrs. Almond&rsquo;s.&nbsp; On the Sunday after the conversation I
have just narrated, this custom was not intermitted and on this
occasion, towards the middle of the evening, Dr. Sloper found
reason to withdraw to the library, with his brother-in-law, to
talk over a matter of business.&nbsp; He was absent some twenty
minutes, and when he came back into the circle, which was
enlivened by the presence of several friends of the family, he
saw that Morris Townsend had come in and had lost as little time
as possible in seating himself on a small sofa, beside
Catherine.&nbsp; In the large room, where several different
groups had been formed, and the hum of voices and of laughter was
loud, these two young persons might confabulate, as the Doctor
phrased it to himself, without attracting attention.&nbsp; He saw
in a moment, however, that his daughter was painfully conscious
of his own observation.&nbsp; She sat motionless, with her eyes
bent down, staring at her open fan, deeply flushed, shrinking
together as if to minimise the indiscretion of which she
confessed herself guilty.</p>
<p>The Doctor almost pitied her.&nbsp; Poor Catherine was not
defiant; she had no genius for bravado; and as she felt that her
father viewed her companion&rsquo;s attentions with an
unsympathising eye, there was nothing but discomfort for her in
the accident of seeming to challenge him.&nbsp; The Doctor felt,
indeed, so sorry for her that he turned away, to spare her the
sense of being watched; and he was so intelligent a man that, in
his thoughts, he rendered a sort of poetic justice to her
situation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be deucedly pleasant for a plain inanimate girl
like that to have a beautiful young fellow come and sit down
beside her and whisper to her that he is her slave&mdash;if that
is what this one whispers.&nbsp; No wonder she likes it, and that
she thinks me a cruel tyrant; which of course she does, though
she is afraid&mdash;she hasn&rsquo;t the animation
necessary&mdash;to admit it to herself.&nbsp; Poor old
Catherine!&rdquo; mused the Doctor; &ldquo;I verily believe she
is capable of defending me when Townsend abuses me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the force of this reflexion, for the moment, was such in
making him feel the natural opposition between his point of view
and that of an infatuated child, that he said to himself that he
was perhaps, after all, taking things too hard and crying out
before he was hurt.&nbsp; He must not condemn Morris Townsend
unheard.&nbsp; He had a great aversion to taking things too hard;
he thought that half the discomfort and many of the
disappointments of life come from it; and for an instant he asked
himself whether, possibly, he did not appear ridiculous to this
intelligent young man, whose private perception of incongruities
he suspected of being keen.&nbsp; At the end of a quarter of an
hour Catherine had got rid of him, and Townsend was now standing
before the fireplace in conversation with Mrs. Almond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will try him again,&rdquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp;
And he crossed the room and joined his sister and her companion,
making her a sign that she should leave the young man to
him.&nbsp; She presently did so, while Morris looked at him,
smiling, without a sign of evasiveness in his affable eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s amazingly conceited!&rdquo; thought the
Doctor; and then he said aloud: &ldquo;I am told you are looking
out for a position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, a position is more than I should presume to call
it,&rdquo; Morris Townsend answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;That sounds so
fine.&nbsp; I should like some quiet work&mdash;something to turn
an honest penny.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of thing should you prefer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean what am I fit for?&nbsp; Very little, I am
afraid.&nbsp; I have nothing but my good right arm, as they say
in the melodramas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are too modest,&rdquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;In addition to your good right arm, you have your subtle
brain.&nbsp; I know nothing of you but what I see; but I see by
your physiognomy that you are extremely intelligent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; Townsend murmured, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what to answer when you say that!&nbsp; You advise me, then, not
to despair?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he looked at his interlocutor as if the question might
have a double meaning.&nbsp; The Doctor caught the look and
weighed it a moment before he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should be
very sorry to admit that a robust and well-disposed young man
need ever despair.&nbsp; If he doesn&rsquo;t succeed in one
thing, he can try another.&nbsp; Only, I should add, he should
choose his line with discretion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes, with discretion,&rdquo; Morris Townsend
repeated sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I have been
indiscreet, formerly; but I think I have got over it.&nbsp; I am
very steady now.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he stood a moment, looking down
at his remarkably neat shoes.&nbsp; Then at last, &ldquo;Were you
kindly intending to propose something for my advantage?&rdquo; he
inquired, looking up and smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn his impudence!&rdquo; the Doctor exclaimed
privately.&nbsp; But in a moment he reflected that he himself
had, after all, touched first upon this delicate point, and that
his words might have been construed as an offer of
assistance.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have no particular proposal to
make,&rdquo; he presently said; &ldquo;but it occurred to me to
let you know that I have you in my mind.&nbsp; Sometimes one
hears of opportunities.&nbsp; For instance&mdash;should you
object to leaving New York&mdash;to going to a
distance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I shouldn&rsquo;t be able to manage
that.&nbsp; I must seek my fortune here or nowhere.&nbsp; You
see,&rdquo; added Morris Townsend, &ldquo;I have ties&mdash;I
have responsibilities here.&nbsp; I have a sister, a widow, from
whom I have been separated for a long time, and to whom I am
almost everything.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t like to say to her
that I must leave her.&nbsp; She rather depends upon me, you
see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s very proper; family feeling is very
proper,&rdquo; said Dr. Sloper.&nbsp; &ldquo;I often think there
is not enough of it in our city.&nbsp; I think I have heard of
your sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is possible, but I rather doubt it; she lives so
very quietly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As quietly, you mean,&rdquo; the Doctor went on, with a
short laugh, &ldquo;as a lady may do who has several young
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my little nephews and nieces&mdash;that&rsquo;s the
very point!&nbsp; I am helping to bring them up,&rdquo; said
Morris Townsend.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am a kind of amateur tutor; I
give them lessons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s very proper, as I say; but it is hardly a
career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t make my fortune!&rdquo; the young man
confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not be too much bent on a fortune,&rdquo; said
the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I assure you I will keep you in
mind; I won&rsquo;t lose sight of you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If my situation becomes desperate I shall perhaps take
the liberty of reminding you!&rdquo; Morris rejoined, raising his
voice a little, with a brighter smile, as his interlocutor turned
away.</p>
<p>Before he left the house the Doctor had a few words with Mrs.
Almond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to see his sister,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you call her?&nbsp; Mrs. Montgomery.&nbsp; I
should like to have a little talk with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try and manage it,&rdquo; Mrs. Almond
responded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will take the first opportunity of
inviting her, and you shall come and meet her.&nbsp; Unless,
indeed,&rdquo; Mrs. Almond added, &ldquo;she first takes it into
her head to be sick and to send for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah no, not that; she must have trouble enough without
that.&nbsp; But it would have its advantages, for then I should
see the children.&nbsp; I should like very much to see the
children.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very thorough.&nbsp; Do you want to catechise
them about their uncle!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely.&nbsp; Their uncle tells me he has charge of
their education, that he saves their mother the expense of
school-bills.&nbsp; I should like to ask them a few questions in
the commoner branches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly has not the cut of a schoolmaster!&rdquo;
Mrs. Almond said to herself a short time afterwards, as she saw
Morris Townsend in a corner bending over her niece, who was
seated.</p>
<p>And there was, indeed, nothing in the young man&rsquo;s
discourse at this moment that savoured of the pedagogue.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you meet me somewhere to-morrow or next
day?&rdquo; he said, in a low tone, to Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meet you?&rdquo; she asked, lifting her frightened
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something particular to say to you&mdash;very
particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you come to the house?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t
you say it there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Townsend shook his head gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
enter your doors again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Townsend!&rdquo; murmured Catherine.&nbsp; She
trembled as she wondered what had happened, whether her father
had forbidden it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t in self-respect,&rdquo; said the young
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your father has insulted me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Insulted you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has taunted me with my poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you are mistaken&mdash;you misunderstood
him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine spoke with energy, getting up from
her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I am too proud&mdash;too sensitive.&nbsp; But
would you have me otherwise?&rdquo; he asked tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where my father is concerned, you must not be
sure.&nbsp; He is full of goodness,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He laughed at me for having no position!&nbsp; I took
it quietly; but only because he belongs to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know what he thinks.&nbsp; I am sure he means to be
kind.&nbsp; You must not be too proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be proud only of you,&rdquo; Morris
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you meet me in the Square in the
afternoon?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A great blush on Catherine&rsquo;s part had been the answer to
the declaration I have just quoted.&nbsp; She turned away,
heedless of his question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you meet me?&rdquo; he repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is very quiet there; no one need see us&mdash;toward
dusk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you who are unkind, it is you who laugh, when you
say such things as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear girl!&rdquo; the young man murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know how little there is in me to be proud
of.&nbsp; I am ugly and stupid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris greeted this remark with an ardent murmur, in which she
recognised nothing articulate but an assurance that she was his
own dearest.</p>
<p>But she went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not even&mdash;I am not
even&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And she paused a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not even brave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, if you are afraid, what shall we
do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated a while; then at last&mdash;&ldquo;You must come
to the house,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I am not afraid of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather it were in the Square,&rdquo; the young
man urged.&nbsp; &ldquo;You know how empty it is, often.&nbsp; No
one will see us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care who sees us!&nbsp; But leave me
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left her resignedly; he had got what he wanted.&nbsp;
Fortunately he was ignorant that half an hour later, going home
with her father and feeling him near, the poor girl, in spite of
her sudden declaration of courage, began to tremble again.&nbsp;
Her father said nothing; but she had an idea his eyes were fixed
upon her in the darkness.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman also was silent;
Morris Townsend had told her that her niece preferred,
unromantically, an interview in a chintz-covered parlour to a
sentimental tryst beside a fountain sheeted with dead leaves, and
she was lost in wonderment at the oddity&mdash;almost the
perversity&mdash;of the choice.</p>
<h2><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> received the young man
the next day on the ground she had chosen&mdash;amid the chaste
upholstery of a New York drawing-room furnished in the fashion of
fifty years ago.&nbsp; Morris had swallowed his pride and made
the effort necessary to cross the threshold of her too derisive
parent&mdash;an act of magnanimity which could not fail to render
him doubly interesting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must settle something&mdash;we must take a
line,&rdquo; he declared, passing his hand through his hair and
giving a glance at the long narrow mirror which adorned the space
between the two windows, and which had at its base a little
gilded bracket covered by a thin slab of white marble, supporting
in its turn a backgammon board folded together in the shape of
two volumes, two shining folios inscribed in letters of greenish
gilt, <i>History of England</i>.&nbsp; If Morris had been pleased
to describe the master of the house as a heartless scoffer, it is
because he thought him too much on his guard, and this was the
easiest way to express his own dissatisfaction&mdash;a
dissatisfaction which he had made a point of concealing from the
Doctor.&nbsp; It will probably seem to the reader, however, that
the Doctor&rsquo;s vigilance was by no means excessive, and that
these two young people had an open field.&nbsp; Their intimacy
was now considerable, and it may appear that for a shrinking and
retiring person our heroine had been liberal of her
favours.&nbsp; The young man, within a few days, had made her
listen to things for which she had not supposed that she was
prepared; having a lively foreboding of difficulties, he
proceeded to gain as much ground as possible in the
present.&nbsp; He remembered that fortune favours the brave, and
even if he had forgotten it, Mrs. Penniman would have remembered
it for him.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman delighted of all things in a
drama, and she flattered herself that a drama would now be
enacted.&nbsp; Combining as she did the zeal of the prompter with
the impatience of the spectator, she had long since done her
utmost to pull up the curtain.&nbsp; She too expected to figure
in the performance&mdash;to be the confidante, the Chorus, to
speak the epilogue.&nbsp; It may even be said that there were
times when she lost sight altogether of the modest heroine of the
play, in the contemplation of certain great passages which would
naturally occur between the hero and herself.</p>
<p>What Morris had told Catherine at last was simply that he
loved her, or rather adored her.&nbsp; Virtually, he had made
known as much already&mdash;his visits had been a series of
eloquent intimations of it.&nbsp; But now he had affirmed it in
lover&rsquo;s vows, and, as a memorable sign of it, he had passed
his arm round the girl&rsquo;s waist and taken a kiss.&nbsp; This
happy certitude had come sooner than Catherine expected, and she
had regarded it, very naturally, as a priceless treasure.&nbsp;
It may even be doubted whether she had ever definitely expected
to possess it; she had not been waiting for it, and she had never
said to herself that at a given moment it must come.&nbsp; As I
have tried to explain, she was not eager and exacting; she took
what was given her from day to day; and if the delightful custom
of her lover&rsquo;s visits, which yielded her a happiness in
which confidence and timidity were strangely blended, had
suddenly come to an end, she would not only not have spoken of
herself as one of the forsaken, but she would not have thought of
herself as one of the disappointed.&nbsp; After Morris had kissed
her, the last time he was with her, as a ripe assurance of his
devotion, she begged him to go away, to leave her alone, to let
her think.&nbsp; Morris went away, taking another kiss
first.&nbsp; But Catherine&rsquo;s meditations had lacked a
certain coherence.&nbsp; She felt his kisses on her lips and on
her cheeks for a long time afterwards; the sensation was rather
an obstacle than an aid to reflexion.&nbsp; She would have liked
to see her situation all clearly before her, to make up her mind
what she should do if, as she feared, her father should tell her
that he disapproved of Morris Townsend.&nbsp; But all that she
could see with any vividness was that it was terribly strange
that anyone should disapprove of him; that there must in that
case be some mistake, some mystery, which in a little while would
be set at rest.&nbsp; She put off deciding and choosing; before
the vision of a conflict with her father she dropped her eyes and
sat motionless, holding her breath and waiting.&nbsp; It made her
heart beat, it was intensely painful.&nbsp; When Morris kissed
her and said these things&mdash;that also made her heart beat;
but this was worse, and it frightened her.&nbsp; Nevertheless,
to-day, when the young man spoke of settling something, taking a
line, she felt that it was the truth, and she answered very
simply and without hesitating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must do our duty,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;we must
speak to my father.&nbsp; I will do it to-night; you must do it
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very good of you to do it first,&rdquo; Morris
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;The young man&mdash;the happy
lover&mdash;generally does that.&nbsp; But just as you
please!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It pleased Catherine to think that she should be brave for his
sake, and in her satisfaction she even gave a little smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Women have more tact,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;they ought to
do it first.&nbsp; They are more conciliating; they can persuade
better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will need all your powers of persuasion.&nbsp; But,
after all,&rdquo; Morris added, &ldquo;you are
irresistible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t speak that way&mdash;and promise me
this.&nbsp; To-morrow, when you talk with father, you will be
very gentle and respectful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As much so as possible,&rdquo; Morris promised.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t be much use, but I shall try.&nbsp; I
certainly would rather have you easily than have to fight for
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk about fighting; we shall not
fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, we must be prepared,&rdquo; Morris rejoined;
&ldquo;you especially, because for you it must come
hardest.&nbsp; Do you know the first thing your father will say
to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Morris; please tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will tell you I am mercenary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mercenary?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big word; but it means a low thing.&nbsp;
It means that I am after your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; murmured Catherine softly.</p>
<p>The exclamation was so deprecating and touching that Morris
indulged in another little demonstration of affection.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But he will be sure to say it,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be easy to be prepared for that,&rdquo;
Catherine said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall simply say that he is
mistaken&mdash;that other men may be that way, but that you are
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must make a great point of that, for it will be his
own great point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine looked at her lover a minute, and then she said,
&ldquo;I shall persuade him.&nbsp; But I am glad we shall be
rich,&rdquo; she added.</p>
<p>Morris turned away, looking into the crown of his hat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s a misfortune,&rdquo; he said at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is from that our difficulty will come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if it is the worst misfortune, we are not so
unhappy.&nbsp; Many people would not think it so bad.&nbsp; I
will persuade him, and after that we shall be very glad we have
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris Townsend listened to this robust logic in
silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will leave my defence to you; it&rsquo;s
a charge that a man has to stoop to defend himself
from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine on her side was silent for a while; she was looking
at him while he looked, with a good deal of fixedness, out of the
window.&nbsp; &ldquo;Morris,&rdquo; she said abruptly, &ldquo;are
you very sure you love me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned round, and in a moment he was bending over
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;My own dearest, can you doubt it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have only known it five days,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;but now it seems to me as if I could never do without
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never be called upon to try!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he gave a little tender, reassuring laugh.&nbsp; Then, in a
moment, he added, &ldquo;There is something you must tell me,
too.&rdquo;&nbsp; She had closed her eyes after the last word she
uttered, and kept them closed; and at this she nodded her head,
without opening them.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must tell me,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;that if your father is dead against me, if he
absolutely forbids our marriage, you will still be
faithful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine opened her eyes, gazing at him, and she could give
no better promise than what he read there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will cleave to me?&rdquo; said Morris.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You know you are your own mistress&mdash;you are of
age.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Morris!&rdquo; she murmured, for all answer.&nbsp;
Or rather not for all; for she put her hand into his own.&nbsp;
He kept it a while, and presently he kissed her again.&nbsp; This
is all that need be recorded of their conversation; but Mrs.
Penniman, if she had been present, would probably have admitted
that it was as well it had not taken place beside the fountain in
Washington Square.</p>
<h2><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>XI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> listened for her father
when he came in that evening, and she heard him go to his
study.&nbsp; She sat quiet, though her heart was beating fast,
for nearly half an hour; then she went and knocked at his
door&mdash;a ceremony without which she never crossed the
threshold of this apartment.&nbsp; On entering it now she found
him in his chair beside the fire, entertaining himself with a
cigar and the evening paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have something to say to you,&rdquo; she began very
gently; and she sat down in the first place that offered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be very happy to hear it, my dear,&rdquo; said
her father.&nbsp; He waited&mdash;waited, looking at her, while
she stared, in a long silence, at the fire.&nbsp; He was curious
and impatient, for he was sure she was going to speak of Morris
Townsend; but he let her take her own time, for he was determined
to be very mild.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am engaged to be married!&rdquo; Catherine announced
at last, still staring at the fire.</p>
<p>The Doctor was startled; the accomplished fact was more than
he had expected.&nbsp; But he betrayed no surprise.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You do right to tell me,&rdquo; he simply said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And who is the happy mortal whom you have honoured with
your choice?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morris Townsend.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as she pronounced
her lover&rsquo;s name, Catherine looked at him.&nbsp; What she
saw was her father&rsquo;s still grey eye and his clear-cut,
definite smile.&nbsp; She contemplated these objects for a
moment, and then she looked back at the fire; it was much
warmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When was this arrangement made?&rdquo; the Doctor
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This afternoon&mdash;two hours ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Mr. Townsend here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, father; in the front parlour.&rdquo;&nbsp; She was
very glad that she was not obliged to tell him that the ceremony
of their betrothal had taken place out there under the bare
ailantus-trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it serious?&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very serious, father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father was silent a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Townsend
ought to have told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means to tell you to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After I know all about it from you?&nbsp; He ought to
have told me before.&nbsp; Does he think I didn&rsquo;t
care&mdash;because I left you so much liberty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;he knew you would
care.&nbsp; And we have been so much obliged to you for&mdash;for
the liberty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor gave a short laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;You might have
made a better use of it, Catherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say that, father,&rdquo; the girl
urged softly, fixing her dull and gentle eyes upon him.</p>
<p>He puffed his cigar awhile, meditatively.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
have gone very fast,&rdquo; he said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Catherine answered simply; &ldquo;I think
we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father glanced at her an instant, removing his eyes from
the fire.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder Mr. Townsend likes
you.&nbsp; You are so simple and so good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why it is&mdash;but he <i>does</i>
like me.&nbsp; I am sure of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And are you very fond of Mr. Townsend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like him very much, of course&mdash;or I
shouldn&rsquo;t consent to marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have known him a very short time, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Catherine, with some eagerness,
&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t take long to like a person&mdash;when
once you begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must have begun very quickly.&nbsp; Was it the
first time you saw him&mdash;that night at your aunt&rsquo;s
party?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father,&rdquo; the girl
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you about
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course; that&rsquo;s your own affair.&nbsp; You will
have observed that I have acted on that principle.&nbsp; I have
not interfered, I have left you your liberty, I have remembered
that you are no longer a little girl&mdash;that you have arrived
at years of discretion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel very old&mdash;and very wise,&rdquo; said
Catherine, smiling faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid that before long you will feel older and
wiser yet.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like your engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Catherine exclaimed softly, getting up from
her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear.&nbsp; I am sorry to give you pain; but I
don&rsquo;t like it.&nbsp; You should have consulted me before
you settled it.&nbsp; I have been too easy with you, and I feel
as if you had taken advantage of my indulgence.&nbsp; Most
decidedly, you should have spoken to me first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine hesitated a moment, and then&mdash;&ldquo;It was
because I was afraid you wouldn&rsquo;t like it!&rdquo; she
confessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, there it is!&nbsp; You had a bad
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I have not a bad conscience, father!&rdquo; the
girl cried out, with considerable energy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please
don&rsquo;t accuse me of anything so dreadful.&rdquo;&nbsp; These
words, in fact, represented to her imagination something very
terrible indeed, something base and cruel, which she associated
with malefactors and prisoners.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was because I was
afraid&mdash;afraid&mdash;&rdquo; she went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were afraid, it was because you had been
foolish!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you didn&rsquo;t like Mr.
Townsend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were quite right.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear father, you don&rsquo;t know him,&rdquo; said
Catherine, in a voice so timidly argumentative that it might have
touched him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very true; I don&rsquo;t know him intimately.&nbsp; But
I know him enough.&nbsp; I have my impression of him.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t know him either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood before the fire, with her hands lightly clasped in
front of her; and her father, leaning back in his chair and
looking up at her, made this remark with a placidity that might
have been irritating.</p>
<p>I doubt, however, whether Catherine was irritated, though she
broke into a vehement protest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
him?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I know him&mdash;better
than I have ever known any one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know a part of him&mdash;what he has chosen to show
you.&nbsp; But you don&rsquo;t know the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The rest?&nbsp; What is the rest?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it may be.&nbsp; There is sure to be plenty of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you mean,&rdquo; said Catherine,
remembering how Morris had forewarned her.&nbsp; &ldquo;You mean
that he is mercenary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father looked up at her still, with his cold, quiet
reasonable eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I meant it, my dear, I should say
it!&nbsp; But there is an error I wish particularly to
avoid&mdash;that of rendering Mr. Townsend more interesting to
you by saying hard things about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t think them hard if they are true,&rdquo;
said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t, you will be a remarkably sensible
young woman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will be your reasons, at any rate, and you will
want me to hear your reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor smiled a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very true.&nbsp; You
have a perfect right to ask for them.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he puffed
his cigar a few moments.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well, then, without
accusing Mr. Townsend of being in love only with your
fortune&mdash;and with the fortune that you justly expect&mdash;I
will say that there is every reason to suppose that these good
things have entered into his calculation more largely than a
tender solicitude for your happiness strictly requires.&nbsp;
There is, of course, nothing impossible in an intelligent young
man entertaining a disinterested affection for you.&nbsp; You are
an honest, amiable girl, and an intelligent young man might
easily find it out.&nbsp; But the principal thing that we know
about this young man&mdash;who is, indeed, very
intelligent&mdash;leads us to suppose that, however much he may
value your personal merits, he values your money more.&nbsp; The
principal thing we know about him is that he has led a life of
dissipation, and has spent a fortune of his own in doing
so.&nbsp; That is enough for me, my dear.&nbsp; I wish you to
marry a young man with other antecedents&mdash;a young man who
could give positive guarantees.&nbsp; If Morris Townsend has
spent his own fortune in amusing himself, there is every reason
to believe that he would spend yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor delivered himself of these remarks slowly,
deliberately, with occasional pauses and prolongations of accent,
which made no great allowance for poor Catherine&rsquo;s suspense
as to his conclusion.&nbsp; She sat down at last, with her head
bent and her eyes still fixed upon him; and strangely
enough&mdash;I hardly know how to tell it&mdash;even while she
felt that what he said went so terribly against her, she admired
his neatness and nobleness of expression.&nbsp; There was
something hopeless and oppressive in having to argue with her
father; but she too, on her side, must try to be clear.&nbsp; He
was so quiet; he was not at all angry; and she too must be
quiet.&nbsp; But her very effort to be quiet made her
tremble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the principal thing we know about
him,&rdquo; she said; and there was a touch of her tremor in her
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are other things&mdash;many other
things.&nbsp; He has very high abilities&mdash;he wants so much
to do something.&nbsp; He is kind, and generous, and true,&rdquo;
said poor Catherine, who had not suspected hitherto the resources
of her eloquence.&nbsp; &ldquo;And his fortune&mdash;his fortune
that he spent&mdash;was very small!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more reason he shouldn&rsquo;t have spent
it,&rdquo; cried the Doctor, getting up, with a laugh.&nbsp; Then
as Catherine, who had also risen to her feet again, stood there
in her rather angular earnestness, wishing so much and expressing
so little, he drew her towards him and kissed her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t think me cruel?&rdquo; he said, holding
her a moment.</p>
<p>This question was not reassuring; it seemed to Catherine, on
the contrary, to suggest possibilities which made her feel
sick.&nbsp; But she answered coherently enough&mdash;&ldquo;No,
dear father; because if you knew how I feel&mdash;and you must
know, you know everything&mdash;you would be so kind, so
gentle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think I know how you feel,&rdquo; the Doctor
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will be very kind&mdash;be sure of
that.&nbsp; And I will see Mr. Townsend to-morrow.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, and for the present, be so good as to mention to no
one that you are engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>XII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morrow, in the afternoon, he
stayed at home, awaiting Mr. Townsend&rsquo;s call&mdash;a
proceeding by which it appeared to him (justly perhaps, for he
was a very busy man) that he paid Catherine&rsquo;s suitor great
honour, and gave both these young people so much the less to
complain of.&nbsp; Morris presented himself with a countenance
sufficiently serene&mdash;he appeared to have forgotten the
&ldquo;insult&rdquo; for which he had solicited Catherine&rsquo;s
sympathy two evenings before, and Dr. Sloper lost no time in
letting him know that he had been prepared for his visit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catherine told me yesterday what has been going on
between you,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must allow me to
say that it would have been becoming of you to give me notice of
your intentions before they had gone so far.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have done so,&rdquo; Morris answered,
&ldquo;if you had not had so much the appearance of leaving your
daughter at liberty.&nbsp; She seems to me quite her own
mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Literally, she is.&nbsp; But she has not emancipated
herself morally quite so far, I trust, as to choose a husband
without consulting me.&nbsp; I have left her at liberty, but I
have not been in the least indifferent.&nbsp; The truth is that
your little affair has come to a head with a rapidity that
surprises me.&nbsp; It was only the other day that Catherine made
your acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not long ago, certainly,&rdquo; said Morris,
with great gravity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I admit that we have not been
slow to&mdash;to arrive at an understanding.&nbsp; But that was
very natural, from the moment we were sure of ourselves&mdash;and
of each other.&nbsp; My interest in Miss Sloper began the first
time I saw her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did it not by chance precede your first meeting?&rdquo;
the Doctor asked.</p>
<p>Morris looked at him an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I certainly had
already heard that she was a charming girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A charming girl&mdash;that&rsquo;s what you think
her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly.&nbsp; Otherwise I should not be sitting
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor meditated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear young
man,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;you must be very
susceptible.&nbsp; As Catherine&rsquo;s father, I have, I trust,
a just and tender appreciation of her many good qualities; but I
don&rsquo;t mind telling you that I have never thought of her as
a charming girl, and never expected any one else to do
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris Townsend received this statement with a smile that was
not wholly devoid of deference.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
what I might think of her if I were her father.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t put myself in that place.&nbsp; I speak from my own
point of view.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak very well,&rdquo; said the Doctor; &ldquo;but
that is not all that is necessary.&nbsp; I told Catherine
yesterday that I disapproved of her engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She let me know as much, and I was very sorry to hear
it.&nbsp; I am greatly disappointed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Morris sat
in silence awhile, looking at the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you really expect I would say I was delighted, and
throw my daughter into your arms?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; I had an idea you didn&rsquo;t like
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What gave you the idea?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fact that I am poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That has a harsh sound,&rdquo; said the Doctor,
&ldquo;but it is about the truth&mdash;speaking of you strictly
as a son-in-law.&nbsp; Your absence of means, of a profession, of
visible resources or prospects, places you in a category from
which it would be imprudent for me to select a husband for my
daughter, who is a weak young woman with a large fortune.&nbsp;
In any other capacity I am perfectly prepared to like you.&nbsp;
As a son-in-law, I abominate you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris Townsend listened respectfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think Miss Sloper is a weak woman,&rdquo; he
presently said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you must defend her&mdash;it&rsquo;s the
least you can do.&nbsp; But I have known my child twenty years,
and you have known her six weeks.&nbsp; Even if she were not
weak, however, you would still be a penniless man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; that is <i>my</i> weakness!&nbsp; And
therefore, you mean, I am mercenary&mdash;I only want your
daughter&rsquo;s money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t say that.&nbsp; I am not obliged to say
it; and to say it, save under stress of compulsion, would be very
bad taste.&nbsp; I say simply that you belong to the wrong
category.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But your daughter doesn&rsquo;t marry a
category,&rdquo; Townsend urged, with his handsome smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She marries an individual&mdash;an individual whom she is
so good as to say she loves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An individual who offers so little in
return!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it possible to offer more than the most tender
affection and a lifelong devotion?&rdquo; the young man
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It depends how we take it.&nbsp; It is possible to
offer a few other things besides; and not only is it possible,
but it&rsquo;s usual.&nbsp; A lifelong devotion is measured after
the fact; and meanwhile it is customary in these cases to give a
few material securities.&nbsp; What are yours?&nbsp; A very
handsome face and figure, and a very good manner.&nbsp; They are
excellent as far as they go, but they don&rsquo;t go far
enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing you should add to them,&rdquo; said
Morris; &ldquo;the word of a gentleman!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word of a gentleman that you will always love
Catherine?&nbsp; You must be a very fine gentleman to be sure of
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The word of a gentleman that I am not mercenary; that
my affection for Miss Sloper is as pure and disinterested a
sentiment as was ever lodged in a human breast!&nbsp; I care no
more for her fortune than for the ashes in that grate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take note&mdash;I take note,&rdquo; said the
Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;But having done so, I turn to our category
again.&nbsp; Even with that solemn vow on your lips, you take
your place in it.&nbsp; There is nothing against you but an
accident, if you will; but with my thirty years&rsquo; medical
practice, I have seen that accidents may have far-reaching
consequences.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris smoothed his hat&mdash;it was already remarkably
glossy&mdash;and continued to display a self-control which, as
the Doctor was obliged to admit, was extremely creditable to
him.&nbsp; But his disappointment was evidently keen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there nothing I can do to make you believe in
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there were I should be sorry to suggest it,
for&mdash;don&rsquo;t you see?&mdash;I don&rsquo;t want to
believe in you!&rdquo; said the Doctor, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would go and dig in the fields.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be foolish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take the first work that offers,
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do so by all means&mdash;but for your own sake, not for
mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see; you think I am an idler!&rdquo; Morris
exclaimed, a little too much in the tone of a man who has made a
discovery.&nbsp; But he saw his error immediately, and
blushed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter what I think, when once I have
told you I don&rsquo;t think of you as a son-in-law.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Morris persisted.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think I would squander
her money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter, as I
say; but I plead guilty to that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s because I spent my own, I suppose,&rdquo;
said Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;I frankly confess that.&nbsp; I have
been wild.&nbsp; I have been foolish.&nbsp; I will tell you every
crazy thing I ever did, if you like.&nbsp; There were some great
follies among the number&mdash;I have never concealed that.&nbsp;
But I have sown my wild oats.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t there some
proverb about a reformed rake?&nbsp; I was not a rake, but I
assure you I have reformed.&nbsp; It is better to have amused
oneself for a while and have done with it.&nbsp; Your daughter
would never care for a milksop; and I will take the liberty of
saying that you would like one quite as little.&nbsp; Besides,
between my money and hers there is a great difference.&nbsp; I
spent my own; it was because it was my own that I spent it.&nbsp;
And I made no debts; when it was gone I stopped.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t owe a penny in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Allow me to inquire what you are living on
now&mdash;though I admit,&rdquo; the Doctor added, &ldquo;that
the question, on my part, is inconsistent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am living on the remnants of my property,&rdquo; said
Morris Townsend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you!&rdquo; the Doctor gravely replied.</p>
<p>Yes, certainly, Morris&rsquo;s self-control was
laudable.&nbsp; &ldquo;Even admitting I attach an undue
importance to Miss Sloper&rsquo;s fortune,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;would not that be in itself an assurance that I should
take much care of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you should take too much care would be quite as
bad as that you should take too little.&nbsp; Catherine might
suffer as much by your economy as by your
extravagance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are very unjust!&rdquo;&nbsp; The young man
made this declaration decently, civilly, without violence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is your privilege to think so, and I surrender my
reputation to you!&nbsp; I certainly don&rsquo;t flatter myself I
gratify you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you care a little to gratify your
daughter?&nbsp; Do you enjoy the idea of making her
miserable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am perfectly resigned to her thinking me a tyrant for
a twelvemonth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a twelvemonth!&rdquo; exclaimed Morris, with a
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a lifetime, then!&nbsp; She may as well be
miserable in that way as in the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here at last Morris lost his temper.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, you are
not polite, sir!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You push me to it&mdash;you argue too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a great deal at stake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever it is,&rdquo; said the Doctor,
&ldquo;you have lost it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of that?&rdquo; asked Morris; &ldquo;are
you sure your daughter will give me up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean, of course, you have lost it as far as I am
concerned.&nbsp; As for Catherine&rsquo;s giving you up&mdash;no,
I am not sure of it.&nbsp; But as I shall strongly recommend it,
as I have a great fund of respect and affection in my
daughter&rsquo;s mind to draw upon, and as she has the sentiment
of duty developed in a very high degree, I think it extremely
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris Townsend began to smooth his hat again.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
too have a fund of affection to draw upon!&rdquo; he observed at
last.</p>
<p>The Doctor at this point showed his own first symptoms of
irritation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to defy me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call it what you please, sir!&nbsp; I mean not to give
your daughter up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor shook his head.&nbsp; &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the
least fear of your pining away your life.&nbsp; You are made to
enjoy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris gave a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your opposition to my
marriage is all the more cruel, then!&nbsp; Do you intend to
forbid your daughter to see me again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is past the age at which people are forbidden, and
I am not a father in an old-fashioned novel.&nbsp; But I shall
strongly urge her to break with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she will,&rdquo; said Morris
Townsend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not.&nbsp; But I shall have done what I
could.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone too far,&rdquo; Morris went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To retreat?&nbsp; Then let her stop where she
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too far to stop, I mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at him a moment; Morris had his hand on the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is a great deal of impertinence in your
saying it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will say no more, sir!&rdquo; Morris answered; and,
making his bow, he left the room.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> may be thought the Doctor was
too positive, and Mrs. Almond intimated as much.&nbsp; But, as he
said, he had his impression; it seemed to him sufficient, and he
had no wish to modify it.&nbsp; He had passed his life in
estimating people (it was part of the medical trade), and in
nineteen cases out of twenty he was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Mr. Townsend is the twentieth case,&rdquo; Mrs.
Almond suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps he is, though he doesn&rsquo;t look to me at
all like a twentieth case.&nbsp; But I will give him the benefit
of the doubt, and, to make sure, I will go and talk with Mrs.
Montgomery.&nbsp; She will almost certainly tell me I have done
right; but it is just possible that she will prove to me that I
have made the greatest mistake of my life.&nbsp; If she does, I
will beg Mr. Townsend&rsquo;s pardon.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t
invite her to meet me, as you kindly proposed; I will write her a
frank letter, telling her how matters stand, and asking leave to
come and see her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid the frankness will be chiefly on your
side.&nbsp; The poor little woman will stand up for her brother,
whatever he may be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever he may be?&nbsp; I doubt that.&nbsp; People
are not always so fond of their brothers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond, &ldquo;when it&rsquo;s a
question of thirty thousand a year coming into a
family&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she stands up for him on account of the money, she
will be a humbug.&nbsp; If she is a humbug I shall see it.&nbsp;
If I see it, I won&rsquo;t waste time with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not a humbug&mdash;she is an exemplary
woman.&nbsp; She will not wish to play her brother a trick simply
because he is selfish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she is worth talking to, she will sooner play him a
trick than that he should play Catherine one.&nbsp; Has she seen
Catherine, by the way&mdash;does she know her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to my knowledge.&nbsp; Mr. Townsend can have had no
particular interest in bringing them together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she is an exemplary woman, no.&nbsp; But we shall
see to what extent she answers your description.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be curious to hear her description of
you!&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond, with a laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;And,
meanwhile, how is Catherine taking it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As she takes everything&mdash;as a matter of
course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t she make a noise?&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t she
made a scene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is not scenic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought a love-lorn maiden was always
scenic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fantastic widow is more so.&nbsp; Lavinia has made me
a speech; she thinks me very arbitrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has a talent for being in the wrong,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Almond.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I am very sorry for Catherine, all
the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So am I.&nbsp; But she will get over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You believe she will give him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I count upon it.&nbsp; She has such an admiration for
her father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we know all about that!&nbsp; But it only makes me
pity her the more.&nbsp; It makes her dilemma the more painful,
and the effort of choosing between you and her lover almost
impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she can&rsquo;t choose, all the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but he will stand there entreating her to choose,
and Lavinia will pull on that side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad she is not on my side; she is capable of
ruining an excellent cause.&nbsp; The day Lavinia gets into your
boat it capsizes.&nbsp; But she had better be careful,&rdquo;
said the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will have no treason in my
house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suspect she will be careful; for she is at bottom
very much afraid of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are both afraid of me&mdash;harmless as I
am!&rdquo; the Doctor answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;And it is on that
that I build&mdash;on the salutary terror I inspire!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>XIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> wrote his frank letter to Mrs.
Montgomery, who punctually answered it, mentioning an hour at
which he might present himself in the Second Avenue.&nbsp; She
lived in a neat little house of red brick, which had been freshly
painted, with the edges of the bricks very sharply marked out in
white.&nbsp; It has now disappeared, with its companions, to make
room for a row of structures more majestic.&nbsp; There were
green shutters upon the windows, without slats, but pierced with
little holes, arranged in groups; and before the house was a
diminutive yard, ornamented with a bush of mysterious character,
and surrounded by a low wooden paling, painted in the same green
as the shutters.&nbsp; The place looked like a magnified
baby-house, and might have been taken down from a shelf in a
toy-shop.&nbsp; Dr. Sloper, when he went to call, said to
himself, as he glanced at the objects I have enumerated, that
Mrs. Montgomery was evidently a thrifty and self-respecting
little person&mdash;the modest proportions of her dwelling seemed
to indicate that she was of small stature&mdash;who took a
virtuous satisfaction in keeping herself tidy, and had resolved
that, since she might not be splendid, she would at least be
immaculate.&nbsp; She received him in a little parlour, which was
precisely the parlour he had expected: a small unspeckled bower,
ornamented with a desultory foliage of tissue-paper, and with
clusters of glass drops, amid which&mdash;to carry out the
analogy&mdash;the temperature of the leafy season was maintained
by means of a cast-iron stove, emitting a dry blue flame, and
smelling strongly of varnish.&nbsp; The walls were embellished
with engravings swathed in pink gauze, and the tables ornamented
with volumes of extracts from the poets, usually bound in black
cloth stamped with florid designs in jaundiced gilt.&nbsp; The
Doctor had time to take cognisance of these details, for Mrs.
Montgomery, whose conduct he pronounced under the circumstances
inexcusable, kept him waiting some ten minutes before she
appeared.&nbsp; At last, however, she rustled in, smoothing down
a stiff poplin dress, with a little frightened flush in a
gracefully-rounded cheek.</p>
<p>She was a small, plump, fair woman, with a bright, clear eye,
and an extraordinary air of neatness and briskness.&nbsp; But
these qualities were evidently combined with an unaffected
humility, and the Doctor gave her his esteem as soon as he had
looked at her.&nbsp; A brave little person, with lively
perceptions, and yet a disbelief in her own talent for social, as
distinguished from practical, affairs&mdash;this was his rapid
mental <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i> of Mrs. Montgomery, who, as he
saw, was flattered by what she regarded as the honour of his
visit.&nbsp; Mrs. Montgomery, in her little red house in the
Second Avenue, was a person for whom Dr. Sloper was one of the
great men, one of the fine gentlemen of New York; and while she
fixed her agitated eyes upon him, while she clasped her mittened
hands together in her glossy poplin lap, she had the appearance
of saying to herself that he quite answered her idea of what a
distinguished guest would naturally be.&nbsp; She apologised for
being late; but he interrupted her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;for
while I sat here I had time to think over what I wish to say to
you, and to make up my mind how to begin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, do begin!&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Montgomery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not so easy,&rdquo; said the Doctor,
smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will have gathered from my letter that
I wish to ask you a few questions, and you may not find it very
comfortable to answer them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I have thought what I should say.&nbsp; It is not
very easy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you must understand my situation&mdash;my state of
mind.&nbsp; Your brother wishes to marry my daughter, and I wish
to find out what sort of a young man he is.&nbsp; A good way to
do so seemed to be to come and ask you; which I have proceeded to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery evidently took the situation very seriously;
she was in a state of extreme moral concentration.&nbsp; She kept
her pretty eyes, which were illumined by a sort of brilliant
modesty, attached to his own countenance, and evidently paid the
most earnest attention to each of his words.&nbsp; Her expression
indicated that she thought his idea of coming to see her a very
superior conception, but that she was really afraid to have
opinions on strange subjects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am extremely glad to see you,&rdquo; she said, in a
tone which seemed to admit, at the same time, that this had
nothing to do with the question.</p>
<p>The Doctor took advantage of this admission.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t come to see you for your pleasure; I came to make
you say disagreeable things&mdash;and you can&rsquo;t like
that.&nbsp; What sort of a gentleman is your brother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s illuminated gaze grew vague, and began
to wander.&nbsp; She smiled a little, and for some time made no
answer, so that the Doctor at last became impatient.&nbsp; And
her answer, when it came, was not satisfactory.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is difficult to talk about one&rsquo;s brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when one is fond of him, and when one has plenty of
good to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, even then, when a good deal depends on it,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Montgomery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing depends on it, for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean for&mdash;for&mdash;&rdquo; and she
hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For your brother himself.&nbsp; I see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean for Miss Sloper,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Montgomery.&nbsp; The Doctor liked this; it had the accent of
sincerity.&nbsp; &ldquo;Exactly; that&rsquo;s the point.&nbsp; If
my poor girl should marry your brother, everything&mdash;as
regards her happiness&mdash;would depend on his being a good
fellow.&nbsp; She is the best creature in the world, and she
could never do him a grain of injury.&nbsp; He, on the other
hand, if he should not be all that we desire, might make her very
miserable.&nbsp; That is why I want you to throw some light upon
his character, you know.&nbsp; Of course you are not bound to do
it.&nbsp; My daughter, whom you have never seen, is nothing to
you; and I, possibly, am only an indiscreet and impertinent old
man.&nbsp; It is perfectly open to you to tell me that my visit
is in very bad taste and that I had better go about my
business.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t think you will do this; because
I think we shall interest you, my poor girl and I.&nbsp; I am
sure that if you were to see Catherine, she would interest you
very much.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t mean because she is interesting in
the usual sense of the word, but because you would feel sorry for
her.&nbsp; She is so soft, so simple-minded, she would be such an
easy victim!&nbsp; A bad husband would have remarkable facilities
for making her miserable; for she would have neither the
intelligence nor the resolution to get the better of him, and yet
she would have an exaggerated power of suffering.&nbsp; I
see,&rdquo; added the Doctor, with his most insinuating, his most
professional laugh, &ldquo;you are already interested!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been interested from the moment he told me he
was engaged,&rdquo; said Mrs. Montgomery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! he says that&mdash;he calls it an
engagement?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he has told me you didn&rsquo;t like it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he tell you that I don&rsquo;t like
<i>him</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he told me that too.&nbsp; I said I couldn&rsquo;t
help it!&rdquo; added Mrs. Montgomery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; But what you can do is
to tell me I am right&mdash;to give me an attestation, as it
were.&rdquo;&nbsp; And the Doctor accompanied this remark with
another professional smile.</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery, however, smiled not at all; it was obvious
that she could not take the humorous view of his appeal.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is a good deal to ask,&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no doubt of that; and I must, in
conscience, remind you of the advantages a young man marrying my
daughter would enjoy.&nbsp; She has an income of ten thousand
dollars in her own right, left her by her mother; if she marries
a husband I approve, she will come into almost twice as much more
at my death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery listened in great earnestness to this splendid
financial statement; she had never heard thousands of dollars so
familiarly talked about.&nbsp; She flushed a little with
excitement.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your daughter will be immensely
rich,&rdquo; she said softly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Precisely&mdash;that&rsquo;s the bother of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if Morris should marry her,
he&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And she hesitated timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be master of all that money?&nbsp; By no
means.&nbsp; He would be master of the ten thousand a year that
she has from her mother; but I should leave every penny of my own
fortune, earned in the laborious exercise of my profession, to
public institutions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery dropped her eyes at this, and sat for some
time gazing at the straw matting which covered her floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it seems to you,&rdquo; said the Doctor,
laughing, &ldquo;that in so doing I should play your brother a
very shabby trick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; That is too much money to get
possession of so easily, by marrying.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think
it would be right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s right to get all one can.&nbsp; But in this
case your brother wouldn&rsquo;t be able.&nbsp; If Catherine
marries without my consent, she doesn&rsquo;t get a penny from my
own pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that certain?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Montgomery, looking
up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As certain as that I sit here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if she should pine away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even if she should pine to a shadow, which isn&rsquo;t
probable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Morris know this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be most happy to inform him!&rdquo; the Doctor
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery resumed her meditations, and her visitor, who
was prepared to give time to the affair, asked himself whether,
in spite of her little conscientious air, she was not playing
into her brother&rsquo;s hands.&nbsp; At the same time he was
half ashamed of the ordeal to which he had subjected her, and was
touched by the gentleness with which she bore it.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
she were a humbug,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;she would get angry;
unless she be very deep indeed.&nbsp; It is not probable that she
is as deep as that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What makes you dislike Morris so much?&rdquo; she
presently asked, emerging from her reflexions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dislike him in the least as a friend, as
a companion.&nbsp; He seems to me a charming fellow, and I should
think he would be excellent company.&nbsp; I dislike him,
exclusively, as a son-in-law.&nbsp; If the only office of a
son-in-law were to dine at the paternal table, I should set a
high value upon your brother.&nbsp; He dines capitally.&nbsp; But
that is a small part of his function, which, in general, is to be
a protector and caretaker of my child, who is singularly
ill-adapted to take care of herself.&nbsp; It is there that he
doesn&rsquo;t satisfy me.&nbsp; I confess I have nothing but my
impression to go by; but I am in the habit of trusting my
impression.&nbsp; Of course you are at liberty to contradict it
flat.&nbsp; He strikes me as selfish and shallow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s eyes expanded a little, and the Doctor
fancied he saw the light of admiration in them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wonder you have discovered he is selfish!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he hides it so well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well indeed,&rdquo; said Mrs. Montgomery.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I think we are all rather selfish,&rdquo; she added
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think so too; but I have seen people hide it better
than he.&nbsp; You see I am helped by a habit I have of dividing
people into classes, into types.&nbsp; I may easily be mistaken
about your brother as an individual, but his type is written on
his whole person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is very good-looking,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Montgomery.</p>
<p>The Doctor eyed her a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;You women are all
the same!&nbsp; But the type to which your brother belongs was
made to be the ruin of you, and you were made to be its handmaids
and victims.&nbsp; The sign of the type in question is the
determination&mdash;sometimes terrible in its quiet
intensity&mdash;to accept nothing of life but its pleasures, and
to secure these pleasures chiefly by the aid of your complaisant
sex.&nbsp; Young men of this class never do anything for
themselves that they can get other people to do for them, and it
is the infatuation, the devotion, the superstition of others that
keeps them going.&nbsp; These others in ninety-nine cases out of
a hundred are women.&nbsp; What our young friends chiefly insist
upon is that some one else shall suffer for them; and women do
that sort of thing, as you must know, wonderfully
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Doctor paused a moment, and then he added
abruptly, &ldquo;You have suffered immensely for your
brother!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This exclamation was abrupt, as I say, but it was also
perfectly calculated.&nbsp; The Doctor had been rather
disappointed at not finding his compact and comfortable little
hostess surrounded in a more visible degree by the ravages of
Morris Townsend&rsquo;s immorality; but he had said to himself
that this was not because the young man had spared her, but
because she had contrived to plaster up her wounds.&nbsp; They
were aching there, behind the varnished stove, the festooned
engravings, beneath her own neat little poplin bosom; and if he
could only touch the tender spot, she would make a movement that
would betray her.&nbsp; The words I have just quoted were an
attempt to put his finger suddenly upon the place; and they had
some of the success that he looked for.&nbsp; The tears sprang
for a moment to Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s eyes, and she indulged in
a proud little jerk of the head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how you have found that out!&rdquo;
she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By a philosophic trick&mdash;by what they call
induction.&nbsp; You know you have always your option of
contradicting me.&nbsp; But kindly answer me a question.&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t you give your brother money?&nbsp; I think you ought
to answer that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I have given him money,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Montgomery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you have not had much to give him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was silent a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you ask me for a
confession of poverty, that is easily made.&nbsp; I am very
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One would never suppose it from your&mdash;your
charming house,&rdquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I learned
from my sister that your income was moderate, and your family
numerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have five children,&rdquo; Mrs. Montgomery observed;
&ldquo;but I am happy to say I can bring them up
decently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you can&mdash;accomplished and devoted as you
are!&nbsp; But your brother has counted them over, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Counted them over?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He knows there are five, I mean.&nbsp; He tells me it
is he that brings them up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery stared a moment, and then
quickly&mdash;&ldquo;Oh yes; he teaches them Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor laughed out.&nbsp; &ldquo;That must take a great
deal off your hands!&nbsp; Your brother also knows, of course,
that you have very little money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have often told him so!&rdquo; Mrs. Montgomery
exclaimed, more unreservedly than she had yet spoken.&nbsp; She
was apparently taking some comfort in the Doctor&rsquo;s
clairvoyancy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which means that you have often occasion to, and that
he often sponges on you.&nbsp; Excuse the crudity of my language;
I simply express a fact.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ask you how much of
your money he has had, it is none of my business.&nbsp; I have
ascertained what I suspected&mdash;what I wished.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the Doctor got up, gently smoothing his hat.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Your brother lives on you,&rdquo; he said as he stood
there.</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery quickly rose from her chair, following her
visitor&rsquo;s movements with a look of fascination.&nbsp; But
then, with a certain inconsequence&mdash;&ldquo;I have never
complained of him!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t protest&mdash;you have not betrayed
him.&nbsp; But I advise you not to give him any more
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you see it is in my interest that he should
marry a rich person?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;If, as you
say, he lives on me, I can only wish to get rid of him, and to
put obstacles in the way of his marrying is to increase my own
difficulties.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish very much you would come to me with your
difficulties,&rdquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Certainly, if
I throw him back on your hands, the least I can do is to help you
to bear the burden.&nbsp; If you will allow me to say so, then, I
shall take the liberty of placing in your hands, for the present,
a certain fund for your brother&rsquo;s support.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery stared; she evidently thought he was jesting;
but she presently saw that he was not, and the complication of
her feelings became painful.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems to me that I
ought to be very much offended with you,&rdquo; she murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I have offered you money?&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a
superstition,&rdquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must let
me come and see you again, and we will talk about these
things.&nbsp; I suppose that some of your children are
girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have two little girls,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Montgomery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, when they grow up, and begin to think of taking
husbands, you will see how anxious you will be about the moral
character of these gentlemen.&nbsp; Then you will understand this
visit of mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are not to believe that Morris&rsquo;s moral
character is bad!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at her a little, with folded arms.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There is something I should greatly like&mdash;as a moral
satisfaction.&nbsp; I should like to hear you say&mdash;&lsquo;He
is abominably selfish!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words came out with the grave distinctness of his voice,
and they seemed for an instant to create, to poor Mrs.
Montgomery&rsquo;s troubled vision, a material image.&nbsp; She
gazed at it an instant, and then she turned away.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You distress me, sir!&rdquo; she exclaimed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is, after all, my brother, and his talents, his
talents&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; On these last words her voice
quavered, and before he knew it she had burst into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;His talents are first-rate!&rdquo; said the
Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;We must find a proper field for
them!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he assured her most respectfully of his
regret at having so greatly discomposed her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all for my poor Catherine,&rdquo; he went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must know her, and you will see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Montgomery brushed away her tears, and blushed at having
shed them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to know your
daughter,&rdquo; she answered; and then, in an
instant&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her marry him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Sloper went away with the words gently humming in his
ears&mdash;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let her marry him!&rdquo;&nbsp;
They gave him the moral satisfaction of which he had just spoken,
and their value was the greater that they had evidently cost a
pang to poor little Mrs. Montgomery&rsquo;s family pride.</p>
<h2><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>XV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> had been puzzled by the way that
Catherine carried herself; her attitude at this sentimental
crisis seemed to him unnaturally passive.&nbsp; She had not
spoken to him again after that scene in the library, the day
before his interview with Morris; and a week had elapsed without
making any change in her manner.&nbsp; There was nothing in it
that appealed for pity, and he was even a little disappointed at
her not giving him an opportunity to make up for his harshness by
some manifestation of liberality which should operate as a
compensation.&nbsp; He thought a little of offering to take her
for a tour in Europe; but he was determined to do this only in
case she should seem mutely to reproach him.&nbsp; He had an idea
that she would display a talent for mute reproaches, and he was
surprised at not finding himself exposed to these silent
batteries.&nbsp; She said nothing, either tacitly or explicitly,
and as she was never very talkative, there was now no especial
eloquence in her reserve.&nbsp; And poor Catherine was not
sulky&mdash;a style of behaviour for which she had too little
histrionic talent; she was simply very patient.&nbsp; Of course
she was thinking over her situation, and she was apparently doing
so in a deliberate and unimpassioned manner, with a view of
making the best of it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will do as I have bidden her,&rdquo; said the
Doctor, and he made the further reflexion that his daughter was
not a woman of a great spirit.&nbsp; I know not whether he had
hoped for a little more resistance for the sake of a little more
entertainment; but he said to himself, as he had said before,
that though it might have its momentary alarms, paternity was,
after all, not an exciting vocation.</p>
<p>Catherine, meanwhile, had made a discovery of a very different
sort; it had become vivid to her that there was a great
excitement in trying to be a good daughter.&nbsp; She had an
entirely new feeling, which may be described as a state of
expectant suspense about her own actions.&nbsp; She watched
herself as she would have watched another person, and wondered
what she would do.&nbsp; It was as if this other person, who was
both herself and not herself, had suddenly sprung into being,
inspiring her with a natural curiosity as to the performance of
untested functions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad I have such a good daughter,&rdquo; said her
father, kissing her, after the lapse of several days.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am trying to be good,&rdquo; she answered, turning
away, with a conscience not altogether clear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is anything you would like to say to me, you
know you must not hesitate.&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t feel obliged
to be so quiet.&nbsp; I shouldn&rsquo;t care that Mr. Townsend
should be a frequent topic of conversation, but whenever you have
anything particular to say about him I shall be very glad to hear
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;I have nothing
particular at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He never asked her whether she had seen Morris again, because
he was sure that if this had been the case she would tell
him.&nbsp; She had, in fact, not seen him, she had only written
him a long letter.&nbsp; The letter at least was long for her;
and, it may be added, that it was long for Morris; it consisted
of five pages, in a remarkably neat and handsome hand.&nbsp;
Catherine&rsquo;s handwriting was beautiful, and she was even a
little proud of it; she was extremely fond of copying, and
possessed volumes of extracts which testified to this
accomplishment; volumes which she had exhibited one day to her
lover, when the bliss of feeling that she was important in his
eyes was exceptionally keen.&nbsp; She told Morris in writing
that her father had expressed the wish that she should not see
him again, and that she begged he would not come to the house
until she should have &ldquo;made up her mind.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Morris replied with a passionate epistle, in which he asked to
what, in Heaven&rsquo;s name, she wished to make up her
mind.&nbsp; Had not her mind been made up two weeks before, and
could it be possible that she entertained the idea of throwing
him off?&nbsp; Did she mean to break down at the very beginning
of their ordeal, after all the promises of fidelity she had both
given and extracted?&nbsp; And he gave an account of his own
interview with her father&mdash;an account not identical at all
points with that offered in these pages.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was
terribly violent,&rdquo; Morris wrote; &ldquo;but you know my
self-control.&nbsp; I have need of it all when I remember that I
have it in my power to break in upon your cruel
captivity.&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine sent him, in answer to this, a
note of three lines.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in great trouble; do not
doubt of my affection, but let me wait a little and
think.&rdquo;&nbsp; The idea of a struggle with her father, of
setting up her will against his own, was heavy on her soul, and
it kept her formally submissive, as a great physical weight keeps
us motionless.&nbsp; It never entered into her mind to throw her
lover off; but from the first she tried to assure herself that
there would be a peaceful way out of their difficulty.&nbsp; The
assurance was vague, for it contained no element of positive
conviction that her father would change his mind.&nbsp; She only
had an idea that if she should be very good, the situation would
in some mysterious manner improve.&nbsp; To be good, she must be
patient, respectful, abstain from judging her father too harshly,
and from committing any act of open defiance.&nbsp; He was
perhaps right, after all, to think as he did; by which Catherine
meant not in the least that his judgement of Morris&rsquo;s
motives in seeking to marry her was perhaps a just one, but that
it was probably natural and proper that conscientious parents
should be suspicious and even unjust.&nbsp; There were probably
people in the world as bad as her father supposed Morris to be,
and if there were the slightest chance of Morris being one of
these sinister persons, the Doctor was right in taking it into
account.&nbsp; Of course he could not know what she knew, how the
purest love and truth were seated in the young man&rsquo;s eyes;
but Heaven, in its time, might appoint a way of bringing him to
such knowledge.&nbsp; Catherine expected a good deal of Heaven,
and referred to the skies the initiative, as the French say, in
dealing with her dilemma.&nbsp; She could not imagine herself
imparting any kind of knowledge to her father, there was
something superior even in his injustice and absolute in his
mistakes.&nbsp; But she could at least be good, and if she were
only good enough, Heaven would invent some way of reconciling all
things&mdash;the dignity of her father&rsquo;s errors and the
sweetness of her own confidence, the strict performance of her
filial duties and the enjoyment of Morris Townsend&rsquo;s
affection.&nbsp; Poor Catherine would have been glad to regard
Mrs. Penniman as an illuminating agent, a part which this lady
herself indeed was but imperfectly prepared to play.&nbsp; Mrs.
Penniman took too much satisfaction in the sentimental shadows of
this little drama to have, for the moment, any great interest in
dissipating them.&nbsp; She wished the plot to thicken, and the
advice that she gave her niece tended, in her own imagination, to
produce this result.&nbsp; It was rather incoherent counsel, and
from one day to another it contradicted itself; but it was
pervaded by an earnest desire that Catherine should do something
striking.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must <i>act</i>, my dear; in your
situation the great thing is to act,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman,
who found her niece altogether beneath her opportunities.&nbsp;
Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s real hope was that the girl would make a
secret marriage, at which she should officiate as brideswoman or
duenna.&nbsp; She had a vision of this ceremony being performed
in some subterranean chapel&mdash;subterranean chapels in New
York were not frequent, but Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s imagination was
not chilled by trifles&mdash;and of the guilty couple&mdash;she
liked to think of poor Catherine and her suitor as the guilty
couple&mdash;being shuffled away in a fast-whirling vehicle to
some obscure lodging in the suburbs, where she would pay them (in
a thick veil) clandestine visits, where they would endure a
period of romantic privation, and where ultimately, after she
should have been their earthly providence, their intercessor,
their advocate, and their medium of communication with the world,
they should be reconciled to her brother in an artistic tableau,
in which she herself should be somehow the central figure.&nbsp;
She hesitated as yet to recommend this course to Catherine, but
she attempted to draw an attractive picture of it to Morris
Townsend.&nbsp; She was in daily communication with the young
man, whom she kept informed by letters of the state of affairs in
Washington Square.&nbsp; As he had been banished, as she said,
from the house, she no longer saw him; but she ended by writing
to him that she longed for an interview.&nbsp; This interview
could take place only on neutral ground, and she bethought
herself greatly before selecting a place of meeting.&nbsp; She
had an inclination for Greenwood Cemetery, but she gave it up as
too distant; she could not absent herself for so long, as she
said, without exciting suspicion.&nbsp; Then she thought of the
Battery, but that was rather cold and windy, besides one&rsquo;s
being exposed to intrusion from the Irish emigrants who at this
point alight, with large appetites, in the New World and at last
she fixed upon an oyster saloon in the Seventh Avenue, kept by a
negro&mdash;an establishment of which she knew nothing save that
she had noticed it in passing.&nbsp; She made an appointment with
Morris Townsend to meet him there, and she went to the tryst at
dusk, enveloped in an impenetrable veil.&nbsp; He kept her
waiting for half an hour&mdash;he had almost the whole width of
the city to traverse&mdash;but she liked to wait, it seemed to
intensify the situation.&nbsp; She ordered a cup of tea, which
proved excessively bad, and this gave her a sense that she was
suffering in a romantic cause.&nbsp; When Morris at last arrived,
they sat together for half an hour in the duskiest corner of a
back shop; and it is hardly too much to say that this was the
happiest half-hour that Mrs. Penniman had known for years.&nbsp;
The situation was really thrilling, and it scarcely seemed to her
a false note when her companion asked for an oyster stew, and
proceeded to consume it before her eyes.&nbsp; Morris, indeed,
needed all the satisfaction that stewed oysters could give him,
for it may be intimated to the reader that he regarded Mrs.
Penniman in the light of a fifth wheel to his coach.&nbsp; He was
in a state of irritation natural to a gentleman of fine parts who
had been snubbed in a benevolent attempt to confer a distinction
upon a young woman of inferior characteristics, and the
insinuating sympathy of this somewhat desiccated matron appeared
to offer him no practical relief.&nbsp; He thought her a humbug,
and he judged of humbugs with a good deal of confidence.&nbsp; He
had listened and made himself agreeable to her at first, in order
to get a footing in Washington Square; and at present he needed
all his self-command to be decently civil.&nbsp; It would have
gratified him to tell her that she was a fantastic old woman, and
that he should like to put her into an omnibus and send her
home.&nbsp; We know, however, that Morris possessed the virtue of
self-control, and he had, moreover, the constant habit of seeking
to be agreeable; so that, although Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s
demeanour only exasperated his already unquiet nerves, he
listened to her with a sombre deference in which she found much
to admire.</p>
<h2><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>XVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">They</span> had of course immediately
spoken of Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did she send me a message,
or&mdash;or anything?&rdquo; Morris asked.&nbsp; He appeared to
think that she might have sent him a trinket or a lock of her
hair.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was slightly embarrassed, for she had not told
her niece of her intended expedition.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not exactly a
message,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t ask her for one,
because I was afraid to&mdash;to excite her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid she is not very excitable!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
Morris gave a smile of some bitterness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is better than that.&nbsp; She is
steadfast&mdash;she is true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she will hold fast, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the death!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I hope it won&rsquo;t come to that,&rdquo; said
Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be prepared for the worst, and that is what I
wish to speak to you about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you call the worst?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, &ldquo;my
brother&rsquo;s hard, intellectual nature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the devil!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is impervious to pity,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman added,
by way of explanation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that he won&rsquo;t come round?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will never be vanquished by argument.&nbsp; I have
studied him.&nbsp; He will be vanquished only by the accomplished
fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The accomplished fact?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will come round afterwards,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman, with extreme significance.&nbsp; &ldquo;He cares for
nothing but facts; he must be met by facts!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; rejoined Morris, &ldquo;it is a fact that
I wish to marry his daughter.&nbsp; I met him with that the other
day, but he was not at all vanquished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was silent a little, and her smile beneath the
shadow of her capacious bonnet, on the edge of which her black
veil was arranged curtain-wise, fixed itself upon Morris&rsquo;s
face with a still more tender brilliancy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Marry
Catherine first and meet him afterwards!&rdquo; she
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you recommend that?&rdquo; asked the young man,
frowning heavily.</p>
<p>She was a little frightened, but she went on with considerable
boldness.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is the way I see it: a private
marriage&mdash;a private marriage.&rdquo;&nbsp; She repeated the
phrase because she liked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that I should carry Catherine off?&nbsp;
What do they call it&mdash;elope with her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a crime when you are driven to it,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;My husband, as I have told you,
was a distinguished clergyman; one of the most eloquent men of
his day.&nbsp; He once married a young couple that had fled from
the house of the young lady&rsquo;s father.&nbsp; He was so
interested in their story.&nbsp; He had no hesitation, and
everything came out beautifully.&nbsp; The father was afterwards
reconciled, and thought everything of the young man.&nbsp; Mr.
Penniman married them in the evening, about seven
o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; The church was so dark, you could scarcely
see; and Mr. Penniman was intensely agitated; he was so
sympathetic.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe he could have done it
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unfortunately Catherine and I have not Mr. Penniman to
marry us,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but you have me!&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Penniman
expressively.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t perform the ceremony,
but I can help you.&nbsp; I can watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The woman&rsquo;s an idiot,&rdquo; thought Morris; but
he was obliged to say something different.&nbsp; It was not,
however, materially more civil.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was it in order to
tell me this that you requested I would meet you here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman had been conscious of a certain vagueness in her
errand, and of not being able to offer him any very tangible
reward for his long walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought perhaps you
would like to see one who is so near to Catherine,&rdquo; she
observed, with considerable majesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
also,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that you would value an
opportunity of sending her something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris extended his empty hands with a melancholy smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am greatly obliged to you, but I have nothing to
send.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you a <i>word</i>?&rdquo; asked his
companion, with her suggestive smile coming back.</p>
<p>Morris frowned again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell her to hold
fast,&rdquo; he said rather curtly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a good word&mdash;a noble word.&nbsp; It will
make her happy for many days.&nbsp; She is very touching, very
brave,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman went on, arranging her mantle and
preparing to depart.&nbsp; While she was so engaged she had an
inspiration.&nbsp; She found the phrase that she could boldly
offer as a vindication of the step she had taken.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you marry Catherine at all risks&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you will
give my brother a proof of your being what he pretends to
doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What he pretends to doubt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know what that is?&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman
asked almost playfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not concern me to know,&rdquo; said Morris
grandly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it makes you angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I despise it,&rdquo; Morris declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you know what it is, then?&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman, shaking her finger at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He pretends
that you like&mdash;you like the money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris hesitated a moment; and then, as if he spoke
advisedly&mdash;&ldquo;I <i>do</i> like the money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but not&mdash;but not as he means it.&nbsp; You
don&rsquo;t like it more than Catherine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned his elbows on the table and buried his head in his
hands.&nbsp; &ldquo;You torture me!&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp;
And, indeed, this was almost the effect of the poor lady&rsquo;s
too importunate interest in his situation.</p>
<p>But she insisted on making her point.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
marry her in spite of him, he will take for granted that you
expect nothing of him, and are prepared to do without it.&nbsp;
And so he will see that you are disinterested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris raised his head a little, following this argument,
&ldquo;And what shall I gain by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, that he will see that he has been wrong in
thinking that you wished to get his money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And seeing that I wish he would go to the deuce with
it, he will leave it to a hospital.&nbsp; Is that what you
mean?&rdquo; asked Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t mean that; though that would be very
grand!&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman quickly added.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean
that having done you such an injustice, he will think it his
duty, at the end, to make some amends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris shook his head, though it must be confessed he was a
little struck with this idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think he is so
sentimental?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not sentimental,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman;
&ldquo;but, to be perfectly fair to him, I think he has, in his
own narrow way, a certain sense of duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There passed through Morris Townsend&rsquo;s mind a rapid
wonder as to what he might, even under a remote contingency, be
indebted to from the action of this principle in Dr.
Sloper&rsquo;s breast, and the inquiry exhausted itself in his
sense of the ludicrous.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your brother has no duties
to me,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;and I none to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but he has duties to Catherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you see that on that principle Catherine has
duties to him as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman got up, with a melancholy sigh, as if she
thought him very unimaginative.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has always
performed them faithfully; and now, do you think she has no
duties to <i>you</i>?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman always, even in
conversation, italicised her personal pronouns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would sound harsh to say so!&nbsp; I am so grateful
for her love,&rdquo; Morris added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell her you said that!&nbsp; And now, remember
that if you need me, I am there.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Penniman,
who could think of nothing more to say, nodded vaguely in the
direction of Washington Square.</p>
<p>Morris looked some moments at the sanded floor of the shop; he
seemed to be disposed to linger a moment.&nbsp; At last, looking
up with a certain abruptness, &ldquo;It is your belief that if
she marries me he will cut her off?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman stared a little, and smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, I
have explained to you what I think would happen&mdash;that in the
end it would be the best thing to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that, whatever she does, in the long run she
will get the money?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t depend upon her, but upon you.&nbsp;
Venture to appear as disinterested as you are!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman ingeniously.&nbsp; Morris dropped his eyes on the sanded
floor again, pondering this; and she pursued.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Penniman and I had nothing, and we were very happy.&nbsp;
Catherine, moreover, has her mother&rsquo;s fortune, which, at
the time my sister-in-law married, was considered a very handsome
one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t speak of that!&rdquo; said Morris; and,
indeed, it was quite superfluous, for he had contemplated the
fact in all its lights.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Austin married a wife with money&mdash;why
shouldn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but your brother was a doctor,&rdquo; Morris
objected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, all young men can&rsquo;t be doctors!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think it an extremely loathsome
profession,&rdquo; said Morris, with an air of intellectual
independence.&nbsp; Then in a moment, he went on rather
inconsequently, &ldquo;Do you suppose there is a will already
made in Catherine&rsquo;s favour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so&mdash;even doctors must die; and perhaps a
little in mine,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman frankly added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you believe he would certainly change it&mdash;as
regards Catherine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and then change it back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but one can&rsquo;t depend on that!&rdquo; said
Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to <i>depend</i> on it?&rdquo; Mrs.
Penniman asked.</p>
<p>Morris blushed a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I am certainly
afraid of being the cause of an injury to Catherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you must not be afraid.&nbsp; Be afraid of nothing,
and everything will go well!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then Mrs. Penniman paid for her cup of tea, and Morris
paid for his oyster stew, and they went out together into the
dimly-lighted wilderness of the Seventh Avenue.&nbsp; The dusk
had closed in completely and the street lamps were separated by
wide intervals of a pavement in which cavities and fissures
played a disproportionate part.&nbsp; An omnibus, emblazoned with
strange pictures, went tumbling over the dislocated
cobble-stones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How will you go home?&rdquo; Morris asked, following
this vehicle with an interested eye.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman had
taken his arm.</p>
<p>She hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think this manner would
be pleasant,&rdquo; she said; and she continued to let him feel
the value of his support.</p>
<p>So he walked with her through the devious ways of the west
side of the town, and through the bustle of gathering nightfall
in populous streets, to the quiet precinct of Washington
Square.&nbsp; They lingered a moment at the foot of Dr.
Sloper&rsquo;s white marble steps, above which a spotless white
door, adorned with a glittering silver plate, seemed to figure,
for Morris, the closed portal of happiness; and then Mrs.
Penniman&rsquo;s companion rested a melancholy eye upon a lighted
window in the upper part of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is my room&mdash;my dear little room!&rdquo; Mrs.
Penniman remarked.</p>
<p>Morris started.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then I needn&rsquo;t come walking
round the Square to gaze at it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s as you please.&nbsp; But Catherine&rsquo;s
is behind; two noble windows on the second floor.&nbsp; I think
you can see them from the other street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see them,
ma&rsquo;am!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Morris turned his back to the
house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will tell her you have been <i>here</i>, at any
rate,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, pointing to the spot where they
stood; &ldquo;and I will give her your message&mdash;that she is
to hold fast!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! of course.&nbsp; You know I write her all
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to say more when it is spoken!&nbsp; And
remember, if you need me, that I am <i>there</i>&rdquo;; and Mrs.
Penniman glanced at the third floor.</p>
<p>On this they separated, and Morris, left to himself, stood
looking at the house a moment; after which he turned away, and
took a gloomy walk round the Square, on the opposite side, close
to the wooden fence.&nbsp; Then he came back, and paused for a
minute in front of Dr. Sloper&rsquo;s dwelling.&nbsp; His eyes
travelled over it; they even rested on the ruddy windows of Mrs.
Penniman&rsquo;s apartment.&nbsp; He thought it a devilish
comfortable house.</p>
<h2><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>XVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Penniman</span> told Catherine that
evening&mdash;the two ladies were sitting in the back
parlour&mdash;that she had had an interview with Morris Townsend;
and on receiving this news the girl started with a sense of
pain.&nbsp; She felt angry for the moment; it was almost the
first time she had ever felt angry.&nbsp; It seemed to her that
her aunt was meddlesome; and from this came a vague apprehension
that she would spoil something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you should have seen him.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t think it was right,&rdquo; Catherine said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was so sorry for him&mdash;it seemed to me some one
ought to see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one but I,&rdquo; said Catherine, who felt as if she
were making the most presumptuous speech of her life, and yet at
the same time had an instinct that she was right in doing so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you wouldn&rsquo;t, my dear,&rdquo; Aunt Lavinia
rejoined; &ldquo;and I didn&rsquo;t know what might have become
of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not seen him, because my father has forbidden
it,&rdquo; Catherine said very simply.</p>
<p>There was a simplicity in this, indeed, which fairly vexed
Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your father forbade you to go to
sleep, I suppose you would keep awake!&rdquo; she commented.</p>
<p>Catherine looked at her.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand
you.&nbsp; You seem to be very strange.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, you will understand me some
day!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Penniman, who was reading the evening
paper, which she perused daily from the first line to the last,
resumed her occupation.&nbsp; She wrapped herself in silence; she
was determined Catherine should ask her for an account of her
interview with Morris.&nbsp; But Catherine was silent for so
long, that she almost lost patience; and she was on the point of
remarking to her that she was very heartless, when the girl at
last spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he is ready to marry you any day, in spite of
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine made no answer to this, and Mrs. Penniman almost
lost patience again; owing to which she at last volunteered the
information that Morris looked very handsome, but terribly
haggard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he seem sad?&rdquo; asked her niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was dark under the eyes,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;So different from when I first saw him;
though I am not sure that if I had seen him in this condition the
first time, I should not have been even more struck with
him.&nbsp; There is something brilliant in his very
misery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was, to Catherine&rsquo;s sense, a vivid picture, and
though she disapproved, she felt herself gazing at it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where did you see him?&rdquo; she asked presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In&mdash;in the Bowery; at a
confectioner&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, who had a
general idea that she ought to dissemble a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whereabouts is the place?&rdquo; Catherine inquired,
after another pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to go there, my dear?&rdquo; said her
aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Catherine got up from her seat
and went to the fire, where she stood looking a while at the
glowing coals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so dry, Catherine?&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman
said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So dry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So cold&mdash;so irresponsive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned very quickly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did <i>he</i> say
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell you
what he said.&nbsp; He said he feared only one thing&mdash;that
you would be afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Afraid of your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine turned back to the fire again, and then, after a
pause, she said&mdash;&ldquo;I <i>am</i> afraid of my
father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman got quickly up from her chair and approached her
niece.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to give him up, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine for some time never moved; she kept her eyes on the
coals.&nbsp; At last she raised her head and looked at her
aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you push me so?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t push you.&nbsp; When have I spoken to you
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me that you have spoken to me several
times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid it is necessary, then, Catherine,&rdquo;
said Mrs. Penniman, with a good deal of solemnity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am afraid you don&rsquo;t feel the importance&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp;
She paused a little; Catherine was looking at her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The importance of not disappointing that gallant young
heart!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Penniman went back to her chair, by
the lamp, and, with a little jerk, picked up the evening paper
again.</p>
<p>Catherine stood there before the fire, with her hands behind
her, looking at her aunt, to whom it seemed that the girl had
never had just this dark fixedness in her gaze.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think you understand&mdash;or that you know
me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t, it is not wonderful; you trust me so
little.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine made no attempt to deny this charge, and for some
time more nothing was said.&nbsp; But Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s
imagination was restless, and the evening paper failed on this
occasion to enchain it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you succumb to the dread of your father&rsquo;s
wrath,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what will
become of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did <i>he</i> tell you to say these things to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to use my influence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken,&rdquo; said Catherine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He trusts me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope he may never repent of it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs.
Penniman gave a little sharp slap to her newspaper.&nbsp; She
knew not what to make of her niece, who had suddenly become stern
and contradictious.</p>
<p>This tendency on Catherine&rsquo;s part was presently even
more apparent.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had much better not make any more
appointments with Mr. Townsend,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think it is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman rose with considerable majesty.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
poor child, are you jealous of me?&rdquo; she inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Lavinia!&rdquo; murmured Catherine,
blushing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is your place to teach me what
is right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On this point Catherine made no concession.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
can&rsquo;t be right to deceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly have not deceived <i>you</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but I promised my father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt you promised your father.&nbsp; But I
have promised him nothing!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine had to admit this, and she did so in silence.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe Mr. Townsend himself likes
it,&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t like meeting me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not in secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was not in secret; the place was full of
people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it was a secret place&mdash;away off in the
Bowery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman flinched a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen enjoy
such things,&rdquo; she remarked presently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know
what gentlemen like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father wouldn&rsquo;t like it, if he
knew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray, do you propose to inform him?&rdquo; Mrs.
Penniman inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Aunt Lavinia.&nbsp; But please don&rsquo;t do it
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do it again, you will inform him: is that what you
mean?&nbsp; I do not share your dread of my brother; I have
always known how to defend my own position.&nbsp; But I shall
certainly never again take any step on your behalf; you are much
too thankless.&nbsp; I knew you were not a spontaneous nature,
but I believed you were firm, and I told your father that he
would find you so.&nbsp; I am disappointed&mdash;but your father
will not be!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with this, Mrs. Penniman offered
her niece a brief good-night, and withdrew to her own
apartment.</p>
<h2><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>XVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Catherine</span> sat alone by the parlour
fire&mdash;sat there for more than an hour, lost in her
meditations.&nbsp; Her aunt seemed to her aggressive and foolish,
and to see it so clearly&mdash;to judge Mrs. Penniman so
positively&mdash;made her feel old and grave.&nbsp; She did not
resent the imputation of weakness; it made no impression on her,
for she had not the sense of weakness, and she was not hurt at
not being appreciated.&nbsp; She had an immense respect for her
father, and she felt that to displease him would be a
misdemeanour analogous to an act of profanity in a great temple;
but her purpose had slowly ripened, and she believed that her
prayers had purified it of its violence.&nbsp; The evening
advanced, and the lamp burned dim without her noticing it; her
eyes were fixed upon her terrible plan.&nbsp; She knew her father
was in his study&mdash;that he had been there all the evening;
from time to time she expected to hear him move.&nbsp; She
thought he would perhaps come, as he sometimes came, into the
parlour.&nbsp; At last the clock struck eleven, and the house was
wrapped in silence; the servants had gone to bed.&nbsp; Catherine
got up and went slowly to the door of the library, where she
waited a moment, motionless.&nbsp; Then she knocked, and then she
waited again.&nbsp; Her father had answered her, but she had not
the courage to turn the latch.&nbsp; What she had said to her
aunt was true enough&mdash;she was afraid of him; and in saying
that she had no sense of weakness she meant that she was not
afraid of herself.&nbsp; She heard him move within, and he came
and opened the door for her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; asked the Doctor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are standing there like a ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went into the room, but it was some time before she
contrived to say what she had come to say.&nbsp; Her father, who
was in his dressing-gown and slippers, had been busy at his
writing-table, and after looking at her for some moments, and
waiting for her to speak, he went and seated himself at his
papers again.&nbsp; His back was turned to her&mdash;she began to
hear the scratching of his pen.&nbsp; She remained near the door,
with her heart thumping beneath her bodice; and she was very glad
that his back was turned, for it seemed to her that she could
more easily address herself to this portion of his person than to
his face.&nbsp; At last she began, watching it while she
spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me that if I should have anything more to say
about Mr. Townsend you would be glad to listen to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, my dear,&rdquo; said the Doctor, not turning
round, but stopping his pen.</p>
<p>Catherine wished it would go on, but she herself
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought I would tell you that I have
not seen him again, but that I should like to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To bid him good-bye?&rdquo; asked the Doctor.</p>
<p>The girl hesitated a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is not going
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor wheeled slowly round in his chair, with a smile
that seemed to accuse her of an epigram; but extremes meet, and
Catherine had not intended one.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not to bid him
good-bye, then?&rdquo; her father said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, father, not that; at least, not for ever.&nbsp; I
have not seen him again, but I should like to see him,&rdquo;
Catherine repeated.</p>
<p>The Doctor slowly rubbed his under lip with the feather of his
quill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you written to him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, four times.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not dismissed him, then.&nbsp; Once would have
done that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Catherine; &ldquo;I have asked
him&mdash;asked him to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father sat looking at her, and she was afraid he was going
to break out into wrath; his eyes were so fine and cold.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a dear, faithful child,&rdquo; he said at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Come here to your father.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
got up, holding out his hands toward her.</p>
<p>The words were a surprise, and they gave her an exquisite
joy.&nbsp; She went to him, and he put his arm round her
tenderly, soothingly; and then he kissed her.&nbsp; After this he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you wish to make me very happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like to&mdash;but I am afraid I
can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; Catherine answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can if you will.&nbsp; It all depends on your
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to give him up?&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is to give him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he held her still, with the same tenderness, looking into
her face and resting his eyes on her averted eyes.&nbsp; There
was a long silence; she wished he would release her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are happier than I, father,&rdquo; she said, at
last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt you are unhappy just now.&nbsp; But it
is better to be unhappy for three months and get over it, than
for many years and never get over it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, if that were so,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be so; I am sure of that.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
answered nothing, and he went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you no faith
in my wisdom, in my tenderness, in my solicitude for your
future?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; murmured the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you suppose that I know something of men:
their vices, their follies, their falsities?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She detached herself, and turned upon him.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is
not vicious&mdash;he is not false!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her father kept looking at her with his sharp, pure eye.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You make nothing of my judgement, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t believe that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you to believe it, but to take it on
trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine was far from saying to herself that this was an
ingenious sophism; but she met the appeal none the less
squarely.&nbsp; &ldquo;What has he done&mdash;what do you
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has never done anything&mdash;he is a selfish
idler.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, don&rsquo;t abuse him!&rdquo; she exclaimed
pleadingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to abuse him; it would be a great
mistake.&nbsp; You may do as you choose,&rdquo; he added, turning
away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may see him again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just as you choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you forgive me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will only be for once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by once.&nbsp; You
must either give him up or continue the acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish to explain&mdash;to tell him to wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To wait for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till you know him better&mdash;till you
consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t tell him any such nonsense as that.&nbsp; I
know him well enough, and I shall never consent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can wait a long time,&rdquo; said poor
Catherine, in a tone which was meant to express the humblest
conciliation, but which had upon her father&rsquo;s nerves the
effect of an iteration not characterised by tact.</p>
<p>The Doctor answered, however, quietly enough: &ldquo;Of course
you can wait till I die, if you like.&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine gave
a cry of natural horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your engagement will have one delightful effect upon
you; it will make you extremely impatient for that
event.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine stood staring, and the Doctor enjoyed the point he
had made.&nbsp; It came to Catherine with the force&mdash;or
rather with the vague impressiveness&mdash;of a logical axiom
which it was not in her province to controvert; and yet, though
it was a scientific truth, she felt wholly unable to accept
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather not marry, if that were true,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a proof of it, then; for it is beyond a
question that by engaging yourself to Morris Townsend you simply
wait for my death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away, feeling sick and faint; and the Doctor went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;And if you wait for it with impatience, judge,
if you please, what <i>his</i> eagerness will be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine turned it over&mdash;her father&rsquo;s words had
such an authority for her that her very thoughts were capable of
obeying him.&nbsp; There was a dreadful ugliness in it, which
seemed to glare at her through the interposing medium of her own
feebler reason.&nbsp; Suddenly, however, she had an
inspiration&mdash;she almost knew it to be an inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t marry before your death, I will not
after,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>To her father, it must be admitted, this seemed only another
epigram; and as obstinacy, in unaccomplished minds, does not
usually select such a mode of expression, he was the more
surprised at this wanton play of a fixed idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that for an impertinence?&rdquo; he
inquired; an inquiry of which, as he made it, he quite perceived
the grossness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An impertinence?&nbsp; Oh, father, what terrible things
you say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t wait for my death, you might as well
marry immediately; there is nothing else to wait for.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For some time Catherine made no answer; but finally she
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think Morris&mdash;little by little&mdash;might
persuade you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never let him speak to me again.&nbsp; I
dislike him too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine gave a long, low sigh; she tried to stifle it, for
she had made up her mind that it was wrong to make a parade of
her trouble, and to endeavour to act upon her father by the
meretricious aid of emotion.&nbsp; Indeed, she even thought it
wrong&mdash;in the sense of being inconsiderate&mdash;to attempt
to act upon his feelings at all; her part was to effect some
gentle, gradual change in his intellectual perception of poor
Morris&rsquo;s character.&nbsp; But the means of effecting such a
change were at present shrouded in mystery, and she felt
miserably helpless and hopeless.&nbsp; She had exhausted all
arguments, all replies.&nbsp; Her father might have pitied her,
and in fact he did so; but he was sure he was right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one thing you can tell Mr. Townsend when you
see him again,&rdquo; he said: &ldquo;that if you marry without
my consent, I don&rsquo;t leave you a farthing of money.&nbsp;
That will interest him more than anything else you can tell
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That would be very right,&rdquo; Catherine
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ought not in that case to have a
farthing of your money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear child,&rdquo; the Doctor observed, laughing,
&ldquo;your simplicity is touching.&nbsp; Make that remark, in
that tone, and with that expression of countenance, to Mr.
Townsend, and take a note of his answer.&nbsp; It won&rsquo;t be
polite&mdash;it will, express irritation; and I shall be glad of
that, as it will put me in the right; unless, indeed&mdash;which
is perfectly possible&mdash;you should like him the better for
being rude to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will never be rude to me,&rdquo; said Catherine
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him what I say, all the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at her father, and her quiet eyes filled with
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I will see him, then,&rdquo; she murmured, in
her timid voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly as you choose!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he went to the
door and opened it for her to go out.&nbsp; The movement gave her
a terrible sense of his turning her off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be only once, for the present,&rdquo; she
added, lingering a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly as you choose,&rdquo; he repeated, standing
there with his hand on the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have told you
what I think.&nbsp; If you see him, you will be an ungrateful,
cruel child; you will have given your old father the greatest
pain of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was more than the poor girl could bear; her tears
overflowed, and she moved towards her grimly consistent parent
with a pitiful cry.&nbsp; Her hands were raised in supplication,
but he sternly evaded this appeal.&nbsp; Instead of letting her
sob out her misery on his shoulder, he simply took her by the arm
and directed her course across the threshold, closing the door
gently but firmly behind her.&nbsp; After he had done so, he
remained listening.&nbsp; For a long time there was no sound; he
knew that she was standing outside.&nbsp; He was sorry for her,
as I have said; but he was so sure he was right.&nbsp; At last he
heard her move away, and then her footstep creaked faintly upon
the stairs.</p>
<p>The Doctor took several turns round his study, with his hands
in his pockets, and a thin sparkle, possibly of irritation, but
partly also of something like humour, in his eye.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
Jove,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;I believe she will
stick&mdash;I believe she will stick!&rdquo;&nbsp; And this idea
of Catherine &ldquo;sticking&rdquo; appeared to have a comical
side, and to offer a prospect of entertainment.&nbsp; He
determined, as he said to himself, to see it out.</p>
<h2><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
123</span>XIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was for reasons connected with
this determination that on the morrow he sought a few words of
private conversation with Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; He sent for her to
the library, and he there informed her that he hoped very much
that, as regarded this affair of Catherine&rsquo;s, she would
mind her <i>p&rsquo;s</i> and <i>q&rsquo;s</i>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by such an
expression,&rdquo; said his sister.&nbsp; &ldquo;You speak as if
I were learning the alphabet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The alphabet of common sense is something you will
never learn,&rdquo; the Doctor permitted himself to respond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you called me here to insult me?&rdquo; Mrs.
Penniman inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; Simply to advise you.&nbsp; You have
taken up young Townsend; that&rsquo;s your own affair.&nbsp; I
have nothing to do with your sentiments, your fancies, your
affections, your delusions; but what I request of you is that you
will keep these things to yourself.&nbsp; I have explained my
views to Catherine; she understands them perfectly, and anything
that she does further in the way of encouraging Mr.
Townsend&rsquo;s attentions will be in deliberate opposition to
my wishes.&nbsp; Anything that you should do in the way of giving
her aid and comfort will be&mdash;permit me the
expression&mdash;distinctly treasonable.&nbsp; You know high
treason is a capital offence; take care how you incur the
penalty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman threw back her head, with a certain expansion of
the eye which she occasionally practised.&nbsp; &ldquo;It seems
to me that you talk like a great autocrat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I talk like my daughter&rsquo;s father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not like your sister&rsquo;s brother!&rdquo; cried
Lavinia.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear Lavinia,&rdquo; said the Doctor,
&ldquo;I sometimes wonder whether I am your brother.&nbsp; We are
so extremely different.&nbsp; In spite of differences, however,
we can, at a pinch, understand each other; and that is the
essential thing just now.&nbsp; Walk straight with regard to Mr.
Townsend; that&rsquo;s all I ask.&nbsp; It is highly probable you
have been corresponding with him for the last three
weeks&mdash;perhaps even seeing him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t ask
you&mdash;you needn&rsquo;t tell me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had a moral
conviction that she would contrive to tell a fib about the
matter, which it would disgust him to listen to.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Whatever you have done, stop doing it.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s
all I wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you wish also by chance to murder our
child?&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary, I wish to make her live and be
happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will kill her; she passed a dreadful
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t die of one dreadful night, nor of a
dozen.&nbsp; Remember that I am a distinguished
physician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman hesitated a moment.&nbsp; Then she risked her
retort.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your being a distinguished physician has not
prevented you from already losing <i>two members</i> of your
family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had risked it, but her brother gave her such a terribly
incisive look&mdash;a look so like a surgeon&rsquo;s
lancet&mdash;that she was frightened at her courage.&nbsp; And he
answered her in words that corresponded to the look: &ldquo;It
may not prevent me, either, from losing the society of still
another.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman took herself off, with whatever air of
depreciated merit was at her command, and repaired to
Catherine&rsquo;s room, where the poor girl was closeted.&nbsp;
She knew all about her dreadful night, for the two had met again,
the evening before, after Catherine left her father.&nbsp; Mrs.
Penniman was on the landing of the second floor when her niece
came upstairs.&nbsp; It was not remarkable that a person of so
much subtlety should have discovered that Catherine had been shut
up with the Doctor.&nbsp; It was still less remarkable that she
should have felt an extreme curiosity to learn the result of this
interview, and that this sentiment, combined with her great
amiability and generosity, should have prompted her to regret the
sharp words lately exchanged between her niece and herself.&nbsp;
As the unhappy girl came into sight, in the dusky corridor, she
made a lively demonstration of sympathy.&nbsp; Catherine&rsquo;s
bursting heart was equally oblivious.&nbsp; She only knew that
her aunt was taking her into her arms.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman drew
her into Catherine&rsquo;s own room, and the two women sat there
together, far into the small hours; the younger one with her head
on the other&rsquo;s lap, sobbing and sobbing at first in a
soundless, stifled manner, and then at last perfectly
still.&nbsp; It gratified Mrs. Penniman to be able to feel
conscientiously that this scene virtually removed the interdict
which Catherine had placed upon her further communion with Morris
Townsend.&nbsp; She was not gratified, however, when, in coming
back to her niece&rsquo;s room before breakfast, she found that
Catherine had risen and was preparing herself for this meal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not go to breakfast,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;you are not well enough, after your fearful
night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am very well, and I am only afraid of being
late.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand you!&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should stay in bed for three
days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I could never do that!&rdquo; said Catherine, to
whom this idea presented no attractions.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was in despair, and she noted, with extreme
annoyance, that the trace of the night&rsquo;s tears had
completely vanished from Catherine&rsquo;s eyes.&nbsp; She had a
most impracticable <i>physique</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;What effect do
you expect to have upon your father,&rdquo; her aunt demanded,
&ldquo;if you come plumping down, without a vestige of any sort
of feeling, as if nothing in the world had happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would not like me to lie in bed,&rdquo; said
Catherine simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more reason for your doing it.&nbsp; How else
do you expect to move him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine thought a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
how; but not in that way.&nbsp; I wish to be just as
usual.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she finished dressing, and, according to
her aunt&rsquo;s expression, went plumping down into the paternal
presence.&nbsp; She was really too modest for consistent
pathos.</p>
<p>And yet it was perfectly true that she had had a dreadful
night.&nbsp; Even after Mrs. Penniman left her she had had no
sleep.&nbsp; She lay staring at the uncomforting gloom, with her
eyes and ears filled with the movement with which her father had
turned her out of his room, and of the words in which he had told
her that she was a heartless daughter.&nbsp; Her heart was
breaking.&nbsp; She had heart enough for that.&nbsp; At moments
it seemed to her that she believed him, and that to do what she
was doing, a girl must indeed be bad.&nbsp; She <i>was</i> bad;
but she couldn&rsquo;t help it.&nbsp; She would try to appear
good, even if her heart were perverted; and from time to time she
had a fancy that she might accomplish something by ingenious
concessions to form, though she should persist in caring for
Morris.&nbsp; Catherine&rsquo;s ingenuities were indefinite, and
we are not called upon to expose their hollowness.&nbsp; The best
of them perhaps showed itself in that freshness of aspect which
was so discouraging to Mrs. Penniman, who was amazed at the
absence of haggardness in a young woman who for a whole night had
lain quivering beneath a father&rsquo;s curse.&nbsp; Poor
Catherine was conscious of her freshness; it gave her a feeling
about the future which rather added to the weight upon her
mind.&nbsp; It seemed a proof that she was strong and solid and
dense, and would live to a great age&mdash;longer than might be
generally convenient; and this idea was depressing, for it
appeared to saddle her with a pretension the more, just when the
cultivation of any pretension was inconsistent with her doing
right.&nbsp; She wrote that day to Morris Townsend, requesting
him to come and see her on the morrow; using very few words, and
explaining nothing.&nbsp; She would explain everything face to
face.</p>
<h2><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>XX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the morrow, in the afternoon,
she heard his voice at the door, and his step in the hall.&nbsp;
She received him in the big, bright front parlour, and she
instructed the servant that if any one should call she was
particularly engaged.&nbsp; She was not afraid of her
father&rsquo;s coming in, for at that hour he was always driving
about town.&nbsp; When Morris stood there before her, the first
thing that she was conscious of was that he was even more
beautiful to look at than fond recollection had painted him; the
next was that he had pressed her in his arms.&nbsp; When she was
free again it appeared to her that she had now indeed thrown
herself into the gulf of defiance, and even, for an instant, that
she had been married to him.</p>
<p>He told her that she had been very cruel, and had made him
very unhappy; and Catherine felt acutely the difficulty of her
destiny, which forced her to give pain in such opposite
quarters.&nbsp; But she wished that, instead of reproaches,
however tender, he would give her help; he was certainly wise
enough, and clever enough, to invent some issue from their
troubles.&nbsp; She expressed this belief, and Morris received
the assurance as if he thought it natural; but he interrogated,
at first&mdash;as was natural too&mdash;rather than committed
himself to marking out a course.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not have made me wait so long,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know how I have been living;
every hour seemed like years.&nbsp; You should have decided
sooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decided?&rdquo; Catherine asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Decided whether you would keep me or give me
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Morris,&rdquo; she cried, with a long tender
murmur, &ldquo;I never thought of giving you up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, then, were you waiting for?&rdquo;&nbsp; The
young man was ardently logical.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought my father might&mdash;might&mdash;&rdquo; and
she hesitated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Might see how unhappy you were?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no!&nbsp; But that he might look at it
differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you have sent for me to tell me that at last he
does so.&nbsp; Is that it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This hypothetical optimism gave the poor girl a pang.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No, Morris,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;he looks at
it still in the same way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why have you sent for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I wanted to see you!&rdquo; cried Catherine
piteously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an excellent reason, surely.&nbsp; But did
you want to look at me only?&nbsp; Have you nothing to tell
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His beautiful persuasive eyes were fixed upon her face, and
she wondered what answer would be noble enough to make to such a
gaze as that.&nbsp; For a moment her own eyes took it in, and
then&mdash;&ldquo;I <i>did</i> want to look at you!&rdquo; she
said gently.&nbsp; But after this speech, most inconsistently,
she hid her face.</p>
<p>Morris watched her for a moment, attentively.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you marry me to-morrow?&rdquo; he asked suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next week, then.&nbsp; Any time within a
month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it better to wait?&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To wait for what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hardly knew for what; but this tremendous leap alarmed
her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Till we have thought about it a little
more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head, sadly and reproachfully.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
thought you had been thinking about it these three weeks.&nbsp;
Do you want to turn it over in your mind for five years?&nbsp;
You have given me more than time enough.&nbsp; My poor
girl,&rdquo; he added in a moment, &ldquo;you are not
sincere!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine coloured from brow to chin, and her eyes filled with
tears.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, how can you say that?&rdquo; she
murmured.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, you must take me or leave me,&rdquo; said Morris,
very reasonably.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can&rsquo;t please your father
and me both; you must choose between us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have chosen you!&rdquo; she said passionately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then marry me next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood gazing at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any
other way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None that I know of for arriving at the same
result.&nbsp; If there is, I should be happy to hear of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine could think of nothing of the kind, and
Morris&rsquo;s luminosity seemed almost pitiless.&nbsp; The only
thing she could think of was that her father might, after all,
come round, and she articulated, with an awkward sense of her
helplessness in doing so, a wish that this miracle might
happen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think it is in the least degree likely?&rdquo;
Morris asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be, if he could only know you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can know me if he will.&nbsp; What is to prevent
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His ideas, his reasons,&rdquo; said Catherine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are so&mdash;so terribly strong.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
trembled with the recollection of them yet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strong?&rdquo; cried Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would
rather you should think them weak.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nothing about my father is weak!&rdquo; said the
girl.</p>
<p>Morris turned away, walking to the window, where he stood
looking out.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are terribly afraid of him!&rdquo;
he remarked at last.</p>
<p>She felt no impulse to deny it, because she had no shame in
it; for if it was no honour to herself, at least it was an honour
to him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose I must be,&rdquo; she said
simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you don&rsquo;t love me&mdash;not as I love
you.&nbsp; If you fear your father more than you love me, then
your love is not what I hoped it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, my friend!&rdquo; she said, going to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do <i>I</i> fear anything?&rdquo; he demanded, turning
round on her.&nbsp; &ldquo;For your sake what am I not ready to
face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are noble&mdash;you are brave!&rdquo; she answered,
stopping short at a distance that was almost respectful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Small good it does me, if you are so timid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I
am&mdash;<i>really</i>,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean by
&lsquo;really.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is really enough to make us
miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be strong enough to wait&mdash;to wait a long
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And suppose after a long time your father should hate
me worse than ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;he couldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would be touched by my fidelity?&nbsp; Is that what
you mean?&nbsp; If he is so easily touched, then why should you
be afraid of him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was much to the point, and Catherine was struck by
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will try not to be,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; And
she stood there submissively, the image, in advance, of a dutiful
and responsible wife.&nbsp; This image could not fail to
recommend itself to Morris Townsend, and he continued to give
proof of the high estimation in which he held her.&nbsp; It could
only have been at the prompting of such a sentiment that he
presently mentioned to her that the course recommended by Mrs.
Penniman was an immediate union, regardless of consequences.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Aunt Penniman would like that,&rdquo; Catherine
said simply&mdash;and yet with a certain shrewdness.&nbsp; It
must, however, have been in pure simplicity, and from motives
quite untouched by sarcasm, that, a few moments after, she went
on to say to Morris that her father had given her a message for
him.&nbsp; It was quite on her conscience to deliver this
message, and had the mission been ten times more painful she
would have as scrupulously performed it.&nbsp; &ldquo;He told me
to tell you&mdash;to tell you very distinctly, and directly from
himself, that if I marry without his consent, I shall not inherit
a penny of his fortune.&nbsp; He made a great point of
this.&nbsp; He seemed to think&mdash;he seemed to
think&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris flushed, as any young man of spirit might have flushed
at an imputation of baseness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he seem to think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That it would make a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It <i>will</i> make a difference&mdash;in many
things.&nbsp; We shall be by many thousands of dollars the
poorer; and that is a great difference.&nbsp; But it will make
none in my affection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall not want the money,&rdquo; said Catherine;
&ldquo;for you know I have a good deal myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, my dear girl, I know you have something.&nbsp; And
he can&rsquo;t touch that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He would never,&rdquo; said Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
mother left it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris was silent a while.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was very positive
about this, was he?&rdquo; he asked at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;He
thought such a message would annoy me terribly, and make me throw
off the mask, eh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what he thought,&rdquo; said
Catherine wearily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please tell him that I care for his message as much as
for that!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Morris snapped his fingers
sonorously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I could tell him that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know you sometimes disappoint me?&rdquo; said
Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should think I might.&nbsp; I disappoint every
one&mdash;father and Aunt Penniman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it doesn&rsquo;t matter with me, because I am
fonder of you than they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Morris,&rdquo; said the girl, with her
imagination&mdash;what there was of it&mdash;swimming in this
happy truth, which seemed, after all, invidious to no one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it your belief that he will stick to it&mdash;stick
to it for ever, to this idea of disinheriting you?&mdash;that
your goodness and patience will never wear out his
cruelty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble is that if I marry you, he will think I am
not good.&nbsp; He will think that a proof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, then, he will never forgive you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This idea, sharply expressed by Morris&rsquo;s handsome lips,
renewed for a moment, to the poor girl&rsquo;s temporarily
pacified conscience, all its dreadful vividness.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh,
you must love me very much!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no doubt of that, my dear!&rdquo; her lover
rejoined.&nbsp; &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t like that word
&lsquo;disinherited,&rsquo;&rdquo; he added in a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t the money; it is that he
should&mdash;that he should feel so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it seems to you a kind of curse,&rdquo; said
Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;It must be very dismal.&nbsp; But
don&rsquo;t you think,&rdquo; he went on presently, &ldquo;that
if you were to try to be very clever, and to set rightly about
it, you might in the end conjure it away?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
think,&rdquo; he continued further, in a tone of sympathetic
speculation, &ldquo;that a really clever woman, in your place,
might bring him round at last?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
think?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here, suddenly, Morris was interrupted; these ingenious
inquiries had not reached Catherine&rsquo;s ears.&nbsp; The
terrible word &ldquo;disinheritance,&rdquo; with all its
impressive moral reprobation, was still ringing there; seemed
indeed to gather force as it lingered.&nbsp; The mortal chill of
her situation struck more deeply into her child-like heart, and
she was overwhelmed by a feeling of loneliness and danger.&nbsp;
But her refuge was there, close to her, and she put out her hands
to grasp it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, Morris,&rdquo; she said, with a
shudder, &ldquo;I will marry you as soon as you
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she surrendered herself, leaning her
head on his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear good girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed, looking down at
his prize.&nbsp; And then he looked up again, rather vaguely,
with parted lips and lifted eyebrows.</p>
<h2><a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>XXI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Sloper</span> very soon imparted his
conviction to Mrs. Almond, in the same terms in which he had
announced it to himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to stick,
by Jove! she&rsquo;s going to stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that she is going to marry him?&rdquo; Mrs.
Almond inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that; but she is not going to break
down.&nbsp; She is going to drag out the engagement, in the hope
of making me relent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shall you not relent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall a geometrical proposition relent?&nbsp; I am not
so superficial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t geometry treat of surfaces?&rdquo; asked
Mrs. Almond, who, as we know, was clever, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but it treats of them profoundly.&nbsp; Catherine
and her young man are my surfaces; I have taken their
measure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You speak as if it surprised you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is immense; there will be a great deal to
observe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are shockingly cold-blooded!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Almond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need to be with all this hot blood about me.&nbsp;
Young Townsend indeed is cool; I must allow him that
merit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t judge him,&rdquo; Mrs. Almond answered;
&ldquo;but I am not at all surprised at Catherine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess I am a little; she must have been so deucedly
divided and bothered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say it amuses you outright!&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t see why
it should be such a joke that your daughter adores
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the point where the adoration stops that I find
it interesting to fix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stops where the other sentiment begins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all&mdash;that would be simple enough.&nbsp; The
two things are extremely mixed up, and the mixture is extremely
odd.&nbsp; It will produce some third element, and that&rsquo;s
what I am waiting to see.&nbsp; I wait with suspense&mdash;with
positive excitement; and that is a sort of emotion that I
didn&rsquo;t suppose Catherine would ever provide for me.&nbsp; I
am really very much obliged to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will cling,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond; &ldquo;she
will certainly cling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; as I say, she will stick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cling is prettier.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what those very
simple natures always do, and nothing could be simpler than
Catherine.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t take many impressions; but
when she takes one she keeps it.&nbsp; She is like a copper
kettle that receives a dent; you may polish up the kettle, but
you can&rsquo;t efface the mark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must try and polish up Catherine,&rdquo; said the
Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will take her to Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She won&rsquo;t forget him in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will forget her, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Almond looked grave.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should you really like
that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Extremely!&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, meanwhile, lost little time in putting herself
again in communication with Morris Townsend.&nbsp; She requested
him to favour her with another interview, but she did not on this
occasion select an oyster saloon as the scene of their
meeting.&nbsp; She proposed that he should join her at the door
of a certain church, after service on Sunday afternoon, and she
was careful not to appoint the place of worship which she usually
visited, and where, as she said, the congregation would have
spied upon her.&nbsp; She picked out a less elegant resort, and
on issuing from its portal at the hour she had fixed she saw the
young man standing apart.&nbsp; She offered him no recognition
till she had crossed the street and he had followed her to some
distance.&nbsp; Here, with a smile&mdash;&ldquo;Excuse my
apparent want of cordiality,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
know what to believe about that.&nbsp; Prudence before
everything.&rdquo;&nbsp; And on his asking her in what direction
they should walk, &ldquo;Where we shall be least observed,&rdquo;
she murmured.</p>
<p>Morris was not in high good-humour, and his response to this
speech was not particularly gallant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
flatter myself we shall be much observed anywhere.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he turned recklessly toward the centre of the town.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I hope you have come to tell me that he has knocked
under,&rdquo; he went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid I am not altogether a harbinger of good;
and yet, too, I am to a certain extent a messenger of
peace.&nbsp; I have been thinking a great deal, Mr.
Townsend,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I do; but I can&rsquo;t help it, my mind is
so terribly active.&nbsp; When I give myself, I give
myself.&nbsp; I pay the penalty in my headaches, my famous
headaches&mdash;a perfect circlet of pain!&nbsp; But I carry it
as a queen carries her crown.&nbsp; Would you believe that I have
one now?&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t, however, have missed our
rendezvous for anything.&nbsp; I have something very important to
tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was perhaps a little headlong the other day in
advising you to marry immediately.&nbsp; I have been thinking it
over, and now I see it just a little differently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to have a great many different ways of seeing
the same object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their number is infinite!&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, in
a tone which seemed to suggest that this convenient faculty was
one of her brightest attributes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I recommend you to take one way and stick to it,&rdquo;
Morris replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! but it isn&rsquo;t easy to choose.&nbsp; My
imagination is never quiet, never satisfied.&nbsp; It makes me a
bad adviser, perhaps; but it makes me a capital
friend!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A capital friend who gives bad advice!&rdquo; said
Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not intentionally&mdash;and who hurries off, at every
risk, to make the most humble excuses!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you advise me now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be very patient; to watch and wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And is that bad advice or good?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not for me to say,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman
rejoined, with some dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I only pretend
it&rsquo;s sincere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will you come to me next week and recommend
something different and equally sincere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may come to you next week and tell you that I am in
the streets!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the streets?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had a terrible scene with my brother, and he
threatens, if anything happens, to turn me out of the
house.&nbsp; You know I am a poor woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris had a speculative idea that she had a little property;
but he naturally did not press this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be very sorry to see you suffer martyrdom for
me,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you make your brother out a
regular Turk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman hesitated a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly do not regard Austin as a satisfactory
Christian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And am I to wait till he is converted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait, at any rate, till he is less violent.&nbsp; Bide
your time, Mr. Townsend; remember the prize is great!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris walked along some time in silence, tapping the railings
and gateposts very sharply with his stick.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly are devilish inconsistent!&rdquo; he
broke out at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have already got Catherine to
consent to a private marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was indeed inconsistent, for at this news she
gave a little jump of gratification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh! when and where?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; And then
she stopped short.</p>
<p>Morris was a little vague about this.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t fixed; but she consents.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s deuced awkward, now, to back out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, as I say, had stopped short; and she stood
there with her eyes fixed brilliantly on her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Townsend,&rdquo; she proceeded, &ldquo;shall I tell
you something?&nbsp; Catherine loves you so much that you may do
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This declaration was slightly ambiguous, and Morris opened his
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy to hear it!&nbsp; But what do you mean by
&lsquo;anything&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may postpone&mdash;you may change about; she
won&rsquo;t think the worse of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris stood there still, with his raised eyebrows; then he
said simply and rather dryly&mdash;&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo;&nbsp; After
this he remarked to Mrs. Penniman that if she walked so slowly
she would attract notice, and he succeeded, after a fashion, in
hurrying her back to the domicile of which her tenure had become
so insecure.</p>
<h2><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>XXII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> had slightly misrepresented the
matter in saying that Catherine had consented to take the great
step.&nbsp; We left her just now declaring that she would burn
her ships behind her; but Morris, after having elicited this
declaration, had become conscious of good reasons for not taking
it up.&nbsp; He avoided, gracefully enough, fixing a day, though
he left her under the impression that he had his eye on
one.&nbsp; Catherine may have had her difficulties; but those of
her circumspect suitor are also worthy of consideration.&nbsp;
The prize was certainly great; but it was only to be won by
striking the happy mean between precipitancy and caution.&nbsp;
It would be all very well to take one&rsquo;s jump and trust to
Providence; Providence was more especially on the side of clever
people, and clever people were known by an indisposition to risk
their bones.&nbsp; The ultimate reward of a union with a young
woman who was both unattractive and impoverished ought to be
connected with immediate disadvantages by some very palpable
chain.&nbsp; Between the fear of losing Catherine and her
possible fortune altogether, and the fear of taking her too soon
and finding this possible fortune as void of actuality as a
collection of emptied bottles, it was not comfortable for Morris
Townsend to choose; a fact that should be remembered by readers
disposed to judge harshly of a young man who may have struck them
as making but an indifferently successful use of fine natural
parts.&nbsp; He had not forgotten that in any event Catherine had
her own ten thousand a year; he had devoted an abundance of
meditation to this circumstance.&nbsp; But with his fine parts he
rated himself high, and he had a perfectly definite appreciation
of his value, which seemed to him inadequately represented by the
sum I have mentioned.&nbsp; At the same time he reminded himself
that this sum was considerable, that everything is relative, and
that if a modest income is less desirable than a large one, the
complete absence of revenue is nowhere accounted an
advantage.&nbsp; These reflexions gave him plenty of occupation,
and made it necessary that he should trim his sail.&nbsp; Dr.
Sloper&rsquo;s opposition was the unknown quantity in the problem
he had to work out.&nbsp; The natural way to work it out was by
marrying Catherine; but in mathematics there are many short cuts,
and Morris was not without a hope that he should yet discover
one.&nbsp; When Catherine took him at his word and consented to
renounce the attempt to mollify her father, he drew back
skilfully enough, as I have said, and kept the wedding-day still
an open question.&nbsp; Her faith in his sincerity was so
complete that she was incapable of suspecting that he was playing
with her; her trouble just now was of another kind.&nbsp; The
poor girl had an admirable sense of honour; and from the moment
she had brought herself to the point of violating her
father&rsquo;s wish, it seemed to her that she had no right to
enjoy his protection.&nbsp; It was on her conscience that she
ought to live under his roof only so long as she conformed to his
wisdom.&nbsp; There was a great deal of glory in such a position,
but poor Catherine felt that she had forfeited her claim to
it.&nbsp; She had cast her lot with a young man against whom he
had solemnly warned her, and broken the contract under which he
provided her with a happy home.&nbsp; She could not give up the
young man, so she must leave the home; and the sooner the object
of her preference offered her another the sooner her situation
would lose its awkward twist.&nbsp; This was close reasoning; but
it was commingled with an infinite amount of merely instinctive
penitence.&nbsp; Catherine&rsquo;s days at this time were dismal,
and the weight of some of her hours was almost more than she
could bear.&nbsp; Her father never looked at her, never spoke to
her.&nbsp; He knew perfectly what he was about, and this was part
of a plan.&nbsp; She looked at him as much as she dared (for she
was afraid of seeming to offer herself to his observation), and
she pitied him for the sorrow she had brought upon him.&nbsp; She
held up her head and busied her hands, and went about her daily
occupations; and when the state of things in Washington Square
seemed intolerable, she closed her eyes and indulged herself with
an intellectual vision of the man for whose sake she had broken a
sacred law.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman, of the three persons in
Washington Square, had much the most of the manner that belongs
to a great crisis.&nbsp; If Catherine was quiet, she was quietly
quiet, as I may say, and her pathetic effects, which there was no
one to notice, were entirely unstudied and unintended.&nbsp; If
the Doctor was stiff and dry and absolutely indifferent to the
presence of his companions, it was so lightly, neatly, easily
done, that you would have had to know him well to discover that,
on the whole, he rather enjoyed having to be so
disagreeable.&nbsp; But Mrs. Penniman was elaborately reserved
and significantly silent; there was a richer rustle in the very
deliberate movements to which she confined herself, and when she
occasionally spoke, in connexion with some very trivial event,
she had the air of meaning something deeper than what she
said.&nbsp; Between Catherine and her father nothing had passed
since the evening she went to speak to him in his study.&nbsp;
She had something to say to him&mdash;it seemed to her she ought
to say it; but she kept it back, for fear of irritating
him.&nbsp; He also had something to say to her; but he was
determined not to speak first.&nbsp; He was interested, as we
know, in seeing how, if she were left to herself, she would
&ldquo;stick.&rdquo;&nbsp; At last she told him she had seen
Morris Townsend again, and that their relations remained quite
the same.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we shall marry&mdash;before very long.&nbsp;
And probably, meanwhile, I shall see him rather often; about once
a week, not more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor looked at her coldly from head to foot, as if she
had been a stranger.&nbsp; It was the first time his eyes had
rested on her for a week, which was fortunate, if that was to be
their expression.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why not three times a day?&rdquo;
he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;What prevents your meeting as often as you
choose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned away a moment; there were tears in her eyes.&nbsp;
Then she said, &ldquo;It is better once a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it is better.&nbsp; It is as bad
as it can be.&nbsp; If you flatter yourself that I care for
little modifications of that sort, you are very much
mistaken.&nbsp; It is as wrong of you to see him once a week as
it would be to see him all day long.&nbsp; Not that it matters to
me, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine tried to follow these words, but they seemed to lead
towards a vague horror from which she recoiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
think we shall marry pretty soon,&rdquo; she repeated at
last.</p>
<p>Her father gave her his dreadful look again, as if she were
some one else.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you tell me that?&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s no concern of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father!&rdquo; she broke out, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
you care, even if you do feel so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a button.&nbsp; Once you marry, it&rsquo;s quite
the same to me when or where or why you do it; and if you think
to compound for your folly by hoisting your flag in this way, you
may spare yourself the trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this he turned away.&nbsp; But the next day he spoke to
her of his own accord, and his manner was somewhat changed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shall you be married within the next four or five
months?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know, father,&rdquo; said
Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not very easy for us to make up our
minds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it off, then, for six months, and in the meantime I
will take you to Europe.&nbsp; I should like you very much to
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It gave her such delight, after his words of the day before,
to hear that he should &ldquo;like&rdquo; her to do something,
and that he still had in his heart any of the tenderness of
preference, that she gave a little exclamation of joy.&nbsp; But
then she became conscious that Morris was not included in this
proposal, and that&mdash;as regards really going&mdash;she would
greatly prefer to remain at home with him.&nbsp; But she blushed,
none the less, more comfortably than she had done of late.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It would be delightful to go to Europe,&rdquo; she
remarked, with a sense that the idea was not original, and that
her tone was not all it might be.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then, we will go.&nbsp; Pack up your
clothes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better tell Mr. Townsend,&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>Her father fixed his cold eyes upon her.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you
mean that you had better ask his leave, all that remains to me is
to hope he will give it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl was sharply touched by the pathetic ring of the
words; it was the most calculated, the most dramatic little
speech the Doctor had ever uttered.&nbsp; She felt that it was a
great thing for her, under the circumstances, to have this fine
opportunity of showing him her respect; and yet there was
something else that she felt as well, and that she presently
expressed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I sometimes think that if I do what you
dislike so much, I ought not to stay with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To stay with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I live with you, I ought to obey you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that&rsquo;s your theory, it&rsquo;s certainly
mine,&rdquo; said the Doctor, with a dry laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if I don&rsquo;t obey you, I ought not to live with
you&mdash;to enjoy your kindness and protection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This striking argument gave the Doctor a sudden sense of
having underestimated his daughter; it seemed even more than
worthy of a young woman who had revealed the quality of
unaggressive obstinacy.&nbsp; But it displeased
him&mdash;displeased him deeply, and he signified as much.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That idea is in very bad taste,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did you get it from Mr. Townsend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no; it&rsquo;s my own!&rdquo; said Catherine
eagerly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it to yourself, then,&rdquo; her father answered,
more than ever determined she should go to Europe.</p>
<h2><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>XXIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Morris Townsend was not to be
included in this journey, no more was Mrs. Penniman, who would
have been thankful for an invitation, but who (to do her justice)
bore her disappointment in a perfectly ladylike manner.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should enjoy seeing the works of Raphael and the
ruins&mdash;the ruins of the Pantheon,&rdquo; she said to Mrs.
Almond; &ldquo;but, on the other hand, I shall not be sorry to be
alone and at peace for the next few months in Washington
Square.&nbsp; I want rest; I have been through so much in the
last four months.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Almond thought it rather
cruel that her brother should not take poor Lavinia abroad; but
she easily understood that, if the purpose of his expedition was
to make Catherine forget her lover, it was not in his interest to
give his daughter this young man&rsquo;s best friend as a
companion.&nbsp; &ldquo;If Lavinia had not been so foolish, she
might visit the ruins of the Pantheon,&rdquo; she said to
herself; and she continued to regret her sister&rsquo;s folly,
even though the latter assured her that she had often heard the
relics in question most satisfactorily described by Mr.
Penniman.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman was perfectly aware that her
brother&rsquo;s motive in undertaking a foreign tour was to lay a
trap for Catherine&rsquo;s constancy; and she imparted this
conviction very frankly to her niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks it will make you forget Morris,&rdquo; she
said (she always called the young man &ldquo;Morris&rdquo; now);
&ldquo;out of sight, out of mind, you know.&nbsp; He thinks that
all the things you will see over there will drive him out of your
thoughts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine looked greatly alarmed.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he thinks
that, I ought to tell him beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman shook her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell him
afterwards, my dear!&nbsp; After he has had all the trouble and
the expense!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the way to serve
him.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she added, in a softer key, that it must be
delightful to think of those who love us among the ruins of the
Pantheon.</p>
<p>Her father&rsquo;s displeasure had cost the girl, as we know,
a great deal of deep-welling sorrow&mdash;sorrow of the purest
and most generous kind, without a touch of resentment or rancour;
but for the first time, after he had dismissed with such
contemptuous brevity her apology for being a charge upon him,
there was a spark of anger in her grief.&nbsp; She had felt his
contempt; it had scorched her; that speech about her bad taste
made her ears burn for three days.&nbsp; During this period she
was less considerate; she had an idea&mdash;a rather vague one,
but it was agreeable to her sense of injury&mdash;that now she
was absolved from penance, and might do what she chose.&nbsp; She
chose to write to Morris Townsend to meet her in the Square and
take her to walk about the town.&nbsp; If she were going to
Europe out of respect to her father, she might at least give
herself this satisfaction.&nbsp; She felt in every way at present
more free and more resolute; there was a force that urged
her.&nbsp; Now at last, completely and unreservedly, her passion
possessed her.</p>
<p>Morris met her at last, and they took a long walk.&nbsp; She
told him immediately what had happened&mdash;that her father
wished to take her away.&nbsp; It would be for six months, to
Europe; she would do absolutely what Morris should think
best.&nbsp; She hoped inexpressibly that he would think it best
she should stay at home.&nbsp; It was some time before he said
what he thought: he asked, as they walked along, a great many
questions.&nbsp; There was one that especially struck her; it
seemed so incongruous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you like to see all those celebrated things over
there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, Morris!&rdquo; said Catherine, quite
deprecatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gracious Heaven, what a dull woman!&rdquo; Morris
exclaimed to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He thinks I will forget you,&rdquo; said Catherine:
&ldquo;that all these things will drive you out of my
mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear, perhaps they will!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; Catherine answered
gently, as they walked along.&nbsp; &ldquo;Poor father will be
disappointed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris gave a little laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, I verily believe
that your poor father will be disappointed!&nbsp; But you will
have seen Europe,&rdquo; he added humorously.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a
take-in!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care for seeing Europe,&rdquo; Catherine
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ought to care, my dear.&nbsp; And it may mollify
your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine, conscious of her obstinacy, expected little of
this, and could not rid herself of the idea that in going abroad
and yet remaining firm, she should play her father a trick.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it would be a kind of
deception?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t he want to deceive you?&rdquo; cried
Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will serve him right!&nbsp; I really
think you had better go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And not be married for so long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be married when you come back.&nbsp; You can buy your
wedding clothes in Paris.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then Morris, with
great kindness of tone, explained his view of the matter.&nbsp;
It would be a good thing that she should go; it would put them
completely in the right.&nbsp; It would show they were reasonable
and willing to wait.&nbsp; Once they were so sure of each other,
they could afford to wait&mdash;what had they to fear?&nbsp; If
there was a particle of chance that her father would be
favourably affected by her going, that ought to settle it; for,
after all, Morris was very unwilling to be the cause of her being
disinherited.&nbsp; It was not for himself, it was for her and
for her children.&nbsp; He was willing to wait for her; it would
be hard, but he could do it.&nbsp; And over there, among
beautiful scenes and noble monuments, perhaps the old gentleman
would be softened; such things were supposed to exert a
humanising influence.&nbsp; He might be touched by her
gentleness, her patience, her willingness to make any sacrifice
but <i>that</i> one; and if she should appeal to him some day, in
some celebrated spot&mdash;in Italy, say, in the evening; in
Venice, in a gondola, by moonlight&mdash;if she should be a
little clever about it and touch the right chord, perhaps he
would fold her in his arms and tell her that he forgave
her.&nbsp; Catherine was immensely struck with this conception of
the affair, which seemed eminently worthy of her lover&rsquo;s
brilliant intellect; though she viewed it askance in so far as it
depended upon her own powers of execution.&nbsp; The idea of
being &ldquo;clever&rdquo; in a gondola by moonlight appeared to
her to involve elements of which her grasp was not active.&nbsp;
But it was settled between them that she should tell her father
that she was ready to follow him obediently anywhere, making the
mental reservation that she loved Morris Townsend more than
ever.</p>
<p>She informed the Doctor she was ready to embark, and he made
rapid arrangements for this event.&nbsp; Catherine had many
farewells to make, but with only two of them are we actively
concerned.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman took a discriminating view of her
niece&rsquo;s journey; it seemed to her very proper that Mr.
Townsend&rsquo;s destined bride should wish to embellish her mind
by a foreign tour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You leave him in good hands,&rdquo; she said, pressing
her lips to Catherine&rsquo;s forehead.&nbsp; (She was very fond
of kissing people&rsquo;s foreheads; it was an involuntary
expression of sympathy with the intellectual part.)&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall see him often; I shall feel like one of the
vestals of old, tending the sacred flame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You behave beautifully about not going with us,&rdquo;
Catherine answered, not presuming to examine this analogy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my pride that keeps me up,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman, tapping the body of her dress, which always gave forth
a sort of metallic ring.</p>
<p>Catherine&rsquo;s parting with her lover was short, and few
words were exchanged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall I find you just the same when I come back?&rdquo;
she asked; though the question was not the fruit of
scepticism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same&mdash;only more so!&rdquo; said Morris,
smiling.</p>
<p>It does not enter into our scheme to narrate in detail Dr.
Sloper&rsquo;s proceedings in the eastern hemisphere.&nbsp; He
made the grand tour of Europe, travelled in considerable
splendour, and (as was to have been expected in a man of his high
cultivation) found so much in art and antiquity to interest him,
that he remained abroad, not for six months, but for
twelve.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman, in Washington Square, accommodated
herself to his absence.&nbsp; She enjoyed her uncontested
dominion in the empty house, and flattered herself that she made
it more attractive to their friends than when her brother was at
home.&nbsp; To Morris Townsend, at least, it would have appeared
that she made it singularly attractive.&nbsp; He was altogether
her most frequent visitor, and Mrs. Penniman was very fond of
asking him to tea.&nbsp; He had his chair&mdash;a very easy one
at the fireside in the back parlour (when the great mahogany
sliding-doors, with silver knobs and hinges, which divided this
apartment from its more formal neighbour, were closed), and he
used to smoke cigars in the Doctor&rsquo;s study, where he often
spent an hour in turning over the curious collections of its
absent proprietor.&nbsp; He thought Mrs. Penniman a goose, as we
know; but he was no goose himself, and, as a young man of
luxurious tastes and scanty resources, he found the house a
perfect castle of indolence.&nbsp; It became for him a club with
a single member.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman saw much less of her sister
than while the Doctor was at home; for Mrs. Almond had felt moved
to tell her that she disapproved of her relations with Mr.
Townsend.&nbsp; She had no business to be so friendly to a young
man of whom their brother thought so meanly, and Mrs. Almond was
surprised at her levity in foisting a most deplorable engagement
upon Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Deplorable?&rdquo; cried Lavinia.&nbsp; &ldquo;He will
make her a lovely husband!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in lovely husbands,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Almond; &ldquo;I only believe in good ones.&nbsp; If he
marries her, and she comes into Austin&rsquo;s money, they may
get on.&nbsp; He will be an idle, amiable, selfish, and doubtless
tolerably good-natured fellow.&nbsp; But if she doesn&rsquo;t get
the money and he finds himself tied to her, Heaven have mercy on
her!&nbsp; He will have none.&nbsp; He will hate her for his
disappointment, and take his revenge; he will be pitiless and
cruel.&nbsp; Woe betide poor Catherine!&nbsp; I recommend you to
talk a little with his sister; it&rsquo;s a pity Catherine
can&rsquo;t marry <i>her</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman had no appetite whatever for conversation with
Mrs. Montgomery, whose acquaintance she made no trouble to
cultivate; and the effect of this alarming forecast of her
niece&rsquo;s destiny was to make her think it indeed a thousand
pities that Mr. Townsend&rsquo;s generous nature should be
embittered.&nbsp; Bright enjoyment was his natural element, and
how could he be comfortable if there should prove to be nothing
to enjoy?&nbsp; It became a fixed idea with Mrs. Penniman that he
should yet enjoy her brother&rsquo;s fortune, on which she had
acuteness enough to perceive that her own claim was small.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t leave it to Catherine, it certainly
won&rsquo;t be to leave it to me,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<h2><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>XXIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Doctor, during the first six
months he was abroad, never spoke to his daughter of their little
difference; partly on system, and partly because he had a great
many other things to think about.&nbsp; It was idle to attempt to
ascertain the state of her affections without direct inquiry,
because, if she had not had an expressive manner among the
familiar influences of home, she failed to gather animation from
the mountains of Switzerland or the monuments of Italy.&nbsp; She
was always her father&rsquo;s docile and reasonable
associate&mdash;going through their sight-seeing in deferential
silence, never complaining of fatigue, always ready to start at
the hour he had appointed over-night, making no foolish
criticisms and indulging in no refinements of appreciation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She is about as intelligent as the bundle of
shawls,&rdquo; the Doctor said; her main superiority being that
while the bundle of shawls sometimes got lost, or tumbled out of
the carriage, Catherine was always at her post, and had a firm
and ample seat.&nbsp; But her father had expected this, and he
was not constrained to set down her intellectual limitations as a
tourist to sentimental depression; she had completely divested
herself of the characteristics of a victim, and during the whole
time that they were abroad she never uttered an audible
sigh.&nbsp; He supposed she was in correspondence with Morris
Townsend; but he held his peace about it, for he never saw the
young man&rsquo;s letters, and Catherine&rsquo;s own missives
were always given to the courier to post.&nbsp; She heard from
her lover with considerable regularity, but his letters came
enclosed in Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s; so that whenever the Doctor
handed her a packet addressed in his sister&rsquo;s hand, he was
an involuntary instrument of the passion he condemned.&nbsp;
Catherine made this reflexion, and six months earlier she would
have felt bound to give him warning; but now she deemed herself
absolved.&nbsp; There was a sore spot in her heart that his own
words had made when once she spoke to him as she thought honour
prompted; she would try and please him as far as she could, but
she would never speak that way again.&nbsp; She read her
lover&rsquo;s letters in secret.</p>
<p>One day at the end of the summer, the two travellers found
themselves in a lonely valley of the Alps.&nbsp; They were
crossing one of the passes, and on the long ascent they had got
out of the carriage and had wandered much in advance.&nbsp; After
a while the Doctor descried a footpath which, leading through a
transverse valley, would bring them out, as he justly supposed,
at a much higher point of the ascent.&nbsp; They followed this
devious way, and finally lost the path; the valley proved very
wild and rough, and their walk became rather a scramble.&nbsp;
They were good walkers, however, and they took their adventure
easily; from time to time they stopped, that Catherine might
rest; and then she sat upon a stone and looked about her at the
hard-featured rocks and the glowing sky.&nbsp; It was late in the
afternoon, in the last of August; night was coming on, and, as
they had reached a great elevation, the air was cold and
sharp.&nbsp; In the west there was a great suffusion of cold, red
light, which made the sides of the little valley look only the
more rugged and dusky.&nbsp; During one of their pauses, her
father left her and wandered away to some high place, at a
distance, to get a view.&nbsp; He was out of sight; she sat there
alone, in the stillness, which was just touched by the vague
murmur, somewhere, of a mountain brook.&nbsp; She thought of
Morris Townsend, and the place was so desolate and lonely that he
seemed very far away.&nbsp; Her father remained absent a long
time; she began to wonder what had become of him.&nbsp; But at
last he reappeared, coming towards her in the clear twilight, and
she got up, to go on.&nbsp; He made no motion to proceed,
however, but came close to her, as if he had something to
say.&nbsp; He stopped in front of her and stood looking at her,
with eyes that had kept the light of the flushing snow-summits on
which they had just been fixed.&nbsp; Then, abruptly, in a low
tone, he asked her an unexpected question:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you given him up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The question was unexpected, but Catherine was only
superficially unprepared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, father!&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>He looked at her again for some moments, without speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he write to you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;about twice a month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor looked up and down the valley, swinging his stick;
then he said to her, in the same low tone:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very angry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered what he meant&mdash;whether he wished to frighten
her.&nbsp; If he did, the place was well chosen; this hard,
melancholy dell, abandoned by the summer light, made her feel her
loneliness.&nbsp; She looked around her, and her heart grew cold;
for a moment her fear was great.&nbsp; But she could think of
nothing to say, save to murmur gently, &ldquo;I am
sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You try my patience,&rdquo; her father went on,
&ldquo;and you ought to know what I am, I am not a very good
man.&nbsp; Though I am very smooth externally, at bottom I am
very passionate; and I assure you I can be very hard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She could not think why he told her these things.&nbsp; Had he
brought her there on purpose, and was it part of a plan?&nbsp;
What was the plan?&nbsp; Catherine asked herself.&nbsp; Was it to
startle her suddenly into a retractation&mdash;to take an
advantage of her by dread?&nbsp; Dread of what?&nbsp; The place
was ugly and lonely, but the place could do her no harm.&nbsp;
There was a kind of still intensity about her father, which made
him dangerous, but Catherine hardly went so far as to say to
herself that it might be part of his plan to fasten his
hand&mdash;the neat, fine, supple hand of a distinguished
physician&mdash;in her throat.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she receded a
step.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sure you can be anything you
please,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; And it was her simple belief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very angry,&rdquo; he replied, more sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why has it taken you so suddenly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has not taken me suddenly.&nbsp; I have been raging
inwardly for the last six months.&nbsp; But just now this seemed
a good place to flare out.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s so quiet, and we are
alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s very quiet,&rdquo; said Catherine
vaguely, looking about her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you come
back to the carriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment.&nbsp; Do you mean that in all this time
you have not yielded an inch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would if I could, father; but I
can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor looked round him too.&nbsp; &ldquo;Should you like
to be left in such a place as this, to starve?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; cried the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will be your fate&mdash;that&rsquo;s how he will
leave you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He would not touch her, but he had touched Morris.&nbsp; The
warmth came back to her heart.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is not true,
father,&rdquo; she broke out, &ldquo;and you ought not to say
it!&nbsp; It is not right, and it&rsquo;s not true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He shook his head slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not
right, because you won&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; But it <i>is</i>
true.&nbsp; Come back to the carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He turned away, and she followed him; he went faster, and was
presently much in advance.&nbsp; But from time to time he
stopped, without turning round, to let her keep up with him, and
she made her way forward with difficulty, her heart beating with
the excitement of having for the first time spoken to him in
violence.&nbsp; By this time it had grown almost dark, and she
ended by losing sight of him.&nbsp; But she kept her course, and
after a little, the valley making a sudden turn, she gained the
road, where the carriage stood waiting.&nbsp; In it sat her
father, rigid and silent; in silence, too, she took her place
beside him.</p>
<p>It seemed to her, later, in looking back upon all this, that
for days afterwards not a word had been exchanged between
them.&nbsp; The scene had been a strange one, but it had not
permanently affected her feeling towards her father, for it was
natural, after all, that he should occasionally make a scene of
some kind, and he had let her alone for six months.&nbsp; The
strangest part of it was that he had said he was not a good man;
Catherine wondered a great deal what he had meant by that.&nbsp;
The statement failed to appeal to her credence, and it was not
grateful to any resentment that she entertained.&nbsp; Even in
the utmost bitterness that she might feel, it would give her no
satisfaction to think him less complete.&nbsp; Such a saying as
that was a part of his great subtlety&mdash;men so clever as he
might say anything and mean anything.&nbsp; And as to his being
hard, that surely, in a man, was a virtue.</p>
<p>He let her alone for six months more&mdash;six months during
which she accommodated herself without a protest to the extension
of their tour.&nbsp; But he spoke again at the end of this time;
it was at the very last, the night before they embarked for New
York, in the hotel at Liverpool.&nbsp; They had been dining
together in a great dim, musty sitting-room; and then the cloth
had been removed, and the Doctor walked slowly up and down.&nbsp;
Catherine at last took her candle to go to bed, but her father
motioned her to stay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean to do when you get home?&rdquo; he
asked, while she stood there with her candle in her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean about Mr. Townsend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About Mr. Townsend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall probably marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor took several turns again while she waited.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you hear from him as much as ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; twice a month,&rdquo; said Catherine promptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And does he always talk about marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&nbsp; That is, he talks about other things too,
but he always says something about that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear he varies his subjects; his letters
might otherwise be monotonous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He writes beautifully,&rdquo; said Catherine, who was
very glad of a chance to say it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They always write beautifully.&nbsp; However, in a
given case that doesn&rsquo;t diminish the merit.&nbsp; So, as
soon as you arrive, you are going off with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed a rather gross way of putting it, and something
that there was of dignity in Catherine resented it.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot tell you till we arrive,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s reasonable enough,&rdquo; her father
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I ask of you&mdash;that
you <i>do</i> tell me, that you give me definite notice.&nbsp;
When a poor man is to lose his only child, he likes to have an
inkling of it beforehand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, you will not lose me!&rdquo; Catherine
said, spilling her candle-wax.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Three days before will do,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;if
you are in a position to be positive then.&nbsp; He ought to be
very thankful to me, do you know.&nbsp; I have done a mighty good
thing for him in taking you abroad; your value is twice as great,
with all the knowledge and taste that you have acquired.&nbsp; A
year ago, you were perhaps a little limited&mdash;a little
rustic; but now you have seen everything, and appreciated
everything, and you will be a most entertaining companion.&nbsp;
We have fattened the sheep for him before he kills it!&rdquo;
Catherine turned away, and stood staring at the blank door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Go to bed,&rdquo; said her father; &ldquo;and, as we
don&rsquo;t go aboard till noon, you may sleep late.&nbsp; We
shall probably have a most uncomfortable voyage.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>XXV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> voyage was indeed
uncomfortable, and Catherine, on arriving in New York, had not
the compensation of &ldquo;going off,&rdquo; in her
father&rsquo;s phrase, with Morris Townsend.&nbsp; She saw him,
however, the day after she landed; and, in the meantime, he
formed a natural subject of conversation between our heroine and
her Aunt Lavinia, with whom, the night she disembarked, the girl
was closeted for a long time before either lady retired to
rest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have seen a great deal of him,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is not very easy to know.&nbsp; I
suppose you think you know him; but you don&rsquo;t, my
dear.&nbsp; You will some day; but it will only be after you have
lived with him.&nbsp; I may almost say <i>I</i> have lived with
him,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman proceeded, while Catherine
stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;I think I know him now; I have had such
remarkable opportunities.&nbsp; You will have the same&mdash;or
rather, you will have better!&rdquo; and Aunt Lavinia
smiled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then you will see what I mean.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a wonderful character, full of passion and energy, and
just as true!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine listened with a mixture of interest and
apprehension.&nbsp; Aunt Lavinia was intensely sympathetic, and
Catherine, for the past year, while she wandered through foreign
galleries and churches, and rolled over the smoothness of posting
roads, nursing the thoughts that never passed her lips, had often
longed for the company of some intelligent person of her own
sex.&nbsp; To tell her story to some kind woman&mdash;at moments
it seemed to her that this would give her comfort, and she had
more than once been on the point of taking the landlady, or the
nice young person from the dressmaker&rsquo;s, into her
confidence.&nbsp; If a woman had been near her she would on
certain occasions have treated such a companion to a fit of
weeping; and she had an apprehension that, on her return, this
would form her response to Aunt Lavinia&rsquo;s first
embrace.&nbsp; In fact, however, the two ladies had met, in
Washington Square, without tears, and when they found themselves
alone together a certain dryness fell upon the girl&rsquo;s
emotion.&nbsp; It came over her with a greater force that Mrs.
Penniman had enjoyed a whole year of her lover&rsquo;s society,
and it was not a pleasure to her to hear her aunt explain and
interpret the young man, speaking of him as if her own knowledge
of him were supreme.&nbsp; It was not that Catherine was jealous;
but her sense of Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s innocent falsity, which
had lain dormant, began to haunt her again, and she was glad that
she was safely at home.&nbsp; With this, however, it was a
blessing to be able to talk of Morris, to sound his name, to be
with a person who was not unjust to him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have been very kind to him,&rdquo; said
Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has written me that, often.&nbsp; I
shall never forget that, Aunt Lavinia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have done what I could; it has been very
little.&nbsp; To let him come and talk to me, and give him his
cup of tea&mdash;that was all.&nbsp; Your Aunt Almond thought it
was too much, and used to scold me terribly; but she promised me,
at least, not to betray me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To betray you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to tell your father.&nbsp; He used to sit in your
father&rsquo;s study!&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, with a little
laugh.</p>
<p>Catherine was silent a moment.&nbsp; This idea was
disagreeable to her, and she was reminded again, with pain, of
her aunt&rsquo;s secretive habits.&nbsp; Morris, the reader may
be informed, had had the tact not to tell her that he sat in her
father&rsquo;s study.&nbsp; He had known her but for a few
months, and her aunt had known her for fifteen years; and yet he
would not have made the mistake of thinking that Catherine would
see the joke of the thing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am sorry you made him
go into father&rsquo;s room,&rdquo; she said, after a while.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t make him go; he went himself.&nbsp; He
liked to look at the books, and all those things in the glass
cases.&nbsp; He knows all about them; he knows all about
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine was silent again; then, &ldquo;I wish he had found
some employment,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has found some employment!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
beautiful news, and he told me to tell you as soon as you
arrived.&nbsp; He has gone into partnership with a commission
merchant.&nbsp; It was all settled, quite suddenly, a week
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This seemed to Catherine indeed beautiful news; it had a fine
prosperous air.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m so glad!&rdquo; she
said; and now, for a moment, she was disposed to throw herself on
Aunt Lavinia&rsquo;s neck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s much better than being under some one; and
he has never been used to that,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman went
on.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is just as good as his partner&mdash;they are
perfectly equal!&nbsp; You see how right he was to wait.&nbsp; I
should like to know what your father can say now!&nbsp; They have
got an office in Duane Street, and little printed cards; he
brought me one to show me.&nbsp; I have got it in my room, and
you shall see it to-morrow.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what he said to me
the last time he was here&mdash;&lsquo;You see how right I was to
wait!&rsquo;&nbsp; He has got other people under him, instead of
being a subordinate.&nbsp; He could never be a subordinate; I
have often told him I could never think of him in that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine assented to this proposition, and was very happy to
know that Morris was his own master; but she was deprived of the
satisfaction of thinking that she might communicate this news in
triumph to her father.&nbsp; Her father would care equally little
whether Morris were established in business or transported for
life.&nbsp; Her trunks had been brought into her room, and
further reference to her lover was for a short time suspended,
while she opened them and displayed to her aunt some of the
spoils of foreign travel.&nbsp; These were rich and abundant; and
Catherine had brought home a present to every one&mdash;to every
one save Morris, to whom she had brought simply her undiverted
heart.&nbsp; To Mrs. Penniman she had been lavishly generous, and
Aunt Lavinia spent half an hour in unfolding and folding again,
with little ejaculations of gratitude and taste.&nbsp; She
marched about for some time in a splendid cashmere shawl, which
Catherine had begged her to accept, settling it on her shoulders,
and twisting down her head to see how low the point descended
behind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall regard it only as a loan,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will leave it to you again when I die; or
rather,&rdquo; she added, kissing her niece again, &ldquo;I will
leave it to your first-born little girl!&rdquo;&nbsp; And draped
in her shawl, she stood there smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better wait till she comes,&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like the way you say that,&rdquo; Mrs.
Penniman rejoined, in a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Catherine, are you
changed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I am the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not swerved a line?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am exactly the same,&rdquo; Catherine repeated,
wishing her aunt were a little less sympathetic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I am glad!&rdquo; and Mrs. Penniman surveyed her
cashmere in the glass.&nbsp; Then, &ldquo;How is your
father?&rdquo; she asked in a moment, with her eyes on her
niece.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your letters were so meagre&mdash;I could
never tell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father is very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you know what I mean,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman,
with a dignity to which the cashmere gave a richer effect.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is he still implacable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite unchanged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is, if possible, more firm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman took off her great shawl, and slowly folded it
up.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is very bad.&nbsp; You had no success with
your little project?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What little project?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Morris told me all about it.&nbsp; The idea of turning
the tables on him, in Europe; of watching him, when he was
agreeably impressed by some celebrated sight&mdash;he pretends to
be so artistic, you know&mdash;and then just pleading with him
and bringing him round.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never tried it.&nbsp; It was Morris&rsquo;s idea; but
if he had been with us, in Europe, he would have seen that father
was never impressed in that way.&nbsp; He <i>is</i>
artistic&mdash;tremendously artistic; but the more celebrated
places we visited, and the more he admired them, the less use it
would have been to plead with him.&nbsp; They seemed only to make
him more determined&mdash;more terrible,&rdquo; said poor
Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall never bring him round, and I
expect nothing now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must say,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman answered,
&ldquo;I never supposed you were going to give it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have given it up.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t care
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have grown very brave,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman,
with a short laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t advise you to
sacrifice your property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am braver than I was.&nbsp; You asked me if I
had changed; I have changed in that way.&nbsp; Oh,&rdquo; the
girl went on, &ldquo;I have changed very much.&nbsp; And it
isn&rsquo;t my property.&nbsp; If <i>he</i> doesn&rsquo;t care
for it, why should I?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman hesitated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps he does care for
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cares for it for my sake, because he doesn&rsquo;t
want to injure me.&nbsp; But he will know&mdash;he knows
already&mdash;how little he need be afraid about that.&nbsp;
Besides,&rdquo; said Catherine, &ldquo;I have got plenty of money
of my own.&nbsp; We shall be very well off; and now hasn&rsquo;t
he got his business?&nbsp; I am delighted about that
business.&rdquo;&nbsp; She went on talking, showing a good deal
of excitement as she proceeded.&nbsp; Her aunt had never seen her
with just this manner, and Mrs. Penniman, observing her, set it
down to foreign travel, which had made her more positive, more
mature.&nbsp; She thought also that Catherine had improved in
appearance; she looked rather handsome.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman
wondered whether Morris Townsend would be struck with that.&nbsp;
While she was engaged in this speculation, Catherine broke out,
with a certain sharpness, &ldquo;Why are you so contradictory,
Aunt Penniman?&nbsp; You seem to think one thing at one time, and
another at another.&nbsp; A year ago, before I went away, you
wished me not to mind about displeasing father; and now you seem
to recommend me to take another line.&nbsp; You change about
so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This attack was unexpected, for Mrs. Penniman was not used, in
any discussion, to seeing the war carried into her own
country&mdash;possibly because the enemy generally had doubts of
finding subsistence there.&nbsp; To her own consciousness, the
flowery fields of her reason had rarely been ravaged by a hostile
force.&nbsp; It was perhaps on this account that in defending
them she was majestic rather than agile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you accuse me of, save of being
too deeply interested in your happiness.&nbsp; It is the first
time I have been told I am capricious.&nbsp; That fault is not
what I am usually reproached with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were angry last year that I wouldn&rsquo;t marry
immediately, and now you talk about my winning my father
over.&nbsp; You told me it would serve him right if he should
take me to Europe for nothing.&nbsp; Well, he has taken me for
nothing, and you ought to be satisfied.&nbsp; Nothing is
changed&mdash;nothing but my feeling about father.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t mind nearly so much now.&nbsp; I have been as good as
I could, but he doesn&rsquo;t care.&nbsp; Now I don&rsquo;t care
either.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know whether I have grown bad;
perhaps I have.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t care for that.&nbsp; I
have come home to be married&mdash;that&rsquo;s all I know.&nbsp;
That ought to please you, unless you have taken up some new idea;
you are so strange.&nbsp; You may do as you please; but you must
never speak to me again about pleading with father.&nbsp; I shall
never plead with him for anything; that is all over.&nbsp; He has
put me off.&nbsp; I am come home to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a more authoritative speech than she had ever heard
on her niece&rsquo;s lips, and Mrs. Penniman was proportionately
startled.&nbsp; She was indeed a little awestruck, and the force
of the girl&rsquo;s emotion and resolution left her nothing to
reply.&nbsp; She was easily frightened, and she always carried
off her discomfiture by a concession; a concession which was
often accompanied, as in the present case, by a little nervous
laugh.</p>
<h2><a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>XXVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">If</span> she had disturbed her
niece&rsquo;s temper&mdash;she began from this moment forward to
talk a good deal about Catherine&rsquo;s temper, an article which
up to that time had never been mentioned in connexion with our
heroine&mdash;Catherine had opportunity, on the morrow, to
recover her serenity.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman had given her a message
from Morris Townsend, to the effect that he would come and
welcome her home on the day after her arrival.&nbsp; He came in
the afternoon; but, as may be imagined, he was not on this
occasion made free of Dr. Sloper&rsquo;s study.&nbsp; He had been
coming and going, for the past year, so comfortably and
irresponsibly, that he had a certain sense of being wronged by
finding himself reminded that he must now limit his horizon to
the front parlour, which was Catherine&rsquo;s particular
province.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very glad you have come back,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;it makes me very happy to see you again.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he looked at her, smiling, from head to foot; though it did not
appear, afterwards, that he agreed with Mrs. Penniman (who,
womanlike, went more into details) in thinking her
embellished.</p>
<p>To Catherine he appeared resplendent; it was some time before
she could believe again that this beautiful young man was her own
exclusive property.&nbsp; They had a great deal of characteristic
lovers&rsquo; talk&mdash;a soft exchange of inquiries and
assurances.&nbsp; In these matters Morris had an excellent grace,
which flung a picturesque interest even over the account of his
d&eacute;but in the commission business&mdash;a subject as to
which his companion earnestly questioned him.&nbsp; From time to
time he got up from the sofa where they sat together, and walked
about the room; after which he came back, smiling and passing his
hand through his hair.&nbsp; He was unquiet, as was natural in a
young man who has just been reunited to a long-absent mistress,
and Catherine made the reflexion that she had never seen him so
excited.&nbsp; It gave her pleasure, somehow, to note this
fact.&nbsp; He asked her questions about her travels, to some of
which she was unable to reply, for she had forgotten the names of
places, and the order of her father&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; But
for the moment she was so happy, so lifted up by the belief that
her troubles at last were over, that she forgot to be ashamed of
her meagre answers.&nbsp; It seemed to her now that she could
marry him without the remnant of a scruple or a single tremor
save those that belonged to joy.&nbsp; Without waiting for him to
ask, she told him that her father had come back in exactly the
same state of mind&mdash;that he had not yielded an inch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must not expect it now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
we must do without it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris sat looking and smiling.&nbsp; &ldquo;My poor dear
girl!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t pity me,&rdquo; said Catherine;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind it now&mdash;I am used to
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris continued to smile, and then he got up and walked about
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better let me try him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try to bring him over?&nbsp; You would only make him
worse,&rdquo; Catherine answered resolutely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say that because I managed it so badly
before.&nbsp; But I should manage it differently now.&nbsp; I am
much wiser; I have had a year to think of it.&nbsp; I have more
tact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what you have been thinking of for a
year?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Much of the time.&nbsp; You see, the idea sticks in my
crop.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t like to be beaten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How are you beaten if we marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course, I am not beaten on the main issue; but I am,
don&rsquo;t you see, on all the rest of it&mdash;on the question
of my reputation, of my relations with your father, of my
relations with my own children, if we should have any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall have enough for our children&mdash;we shall
have enough for everything.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you expect to
succeed in business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brilliantly, and we shall certainly be very
comfortable.&nbsp; But it isn&rsquo;t of the mere material
comfort I speak; it is of the moral comfort,&rdquo; said
Morris&mdash;&ldquo;of the intellectual satisfaction!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have great moral comfort now,&rdquo; Catherine
declared, very simply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you have.&nbsp; But with me it is
different.&nbsp; I have staked my pride on proving to your father
that he is wrong; and now that I am at the head of a flourishing
business, I can deal with him as an equal.&nbsp; I have a capital
plan&mdash;do let me go at him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood before her with his bright face, his jaunty air, his
hands in his pockets; and she got up, with her eyes resting on
his own.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, Morris; please
don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said; and there was a certain mild, sad
firmness in her tone which he heard for the first time.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We must ask no favours of him&mdash;we must ask nothing
more.&nbsp; He won&rsquo;t relent, and nothing good will come of
it.&nbsp; I know it now&mdash;I have a very good
reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray; what is your reason?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated to bring it out, but at last it came.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is not very fond of me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, bother!&rdquo; cried Morris angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t say such a thing without being
sure.&nbsp; I saw it, I felt it, in England, just before he came
away.&nbsp; He talked to me one night&mdash;the last night; and
then it came over me.&nbsp; You can tell when a person feels that
way.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t accuse him if he hadn&rsquo;t made me
feel that way.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t accuse him; I just tell you
that that&rsquo;s how it is.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t help it; we
can&rsquo;t govern our affections.&nbsp; Do I govern mine?
mightn&rsquo;t he say that to me?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because he is
so fond of my mother, whom we lost so long ago.&nbsp; She was
beautiful, and very, very brilliant; he is always thinking of
her.&nbsp; I am not at all like her; Aunt Penniman has told me
that.&nbsp; Of course, it isn&rsquo;t my fault; but neither is it
his fault.&nbsp; All I mean is, it&rsquo;s true; and it&rsquo;s a
stronger reason for his never being reconciled than simply his
dislike for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Simply?&rsquo;&rdquo; cried Morris, with a
laugh, &ldquo;I am much obliged for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mind about his disliking you now; I mind
everything less.&nbsp; I feel differently; I feel separated from
my father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; said Morris, &ldquo;you are a
queer family!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that&mdash;don&rsquo;t say anything
unkind,&rdquo; the girl entreated.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must be very
kind to me now, because, Morris&mdash;because,&rdquo; and she
hesitated a moment&mdash;&ldquo;because I have done a great deal
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I know that, my dear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had spoken up to this moment without vehemence or outward
sign of emotion, gently, reasoningly, only trying to
explain.&nbsp; But her emotion had been ineffectually smothered,
and it betrayed itself at last in the trembling of her
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is a great thing to be separated like that
from your father, when you have worshipped him before.&nbsp; It
has made me very unhappy; or it would have made me so if I
didn&rsquo;t love you.&nbsp; You can tell when a person speaks to
you as if&mdash;as if&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if they despised you!&rdquo; said Catherine
passionately.&nbsp; &ldquo;He spoke that way the night before we
sailed.&nbsp; It wasn&rsquo;t much, but it was enough, and I
thought of it on the voyage, all the time.&nbsp; Then I made up
my mind.&nbsp; I will never ask him for anything again, or expect
anything from him.&nbsp; It would not be natural now.&nbsp; We
must be very happy together, and we must not seem to depend upon
his forgiveness.&nbsp; And Morris, Morris, you must never despise
me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was an easy promise to make, and Morris made it with fine
effect.&nbsp; But for the moment he undertook nothing more
onerous.</p>
<h2><a name="page172"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
172</span>XXVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Doctor, of course, on his
return, had a good deal of talk with his sisters.&nbsp; He was at
no great pains to narrate his travels or to communicate his
impressions of distant lands to Mrs. Penniman, upon whom he
contented himself with bestowing a memento of his enviable
experience, in the shape of a velvet gown.&nbsp; But he conversed
with her at some length about matters nearer home, and lost no
time in assuring her that he was still an inflexible father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no doubt you have seen a great deal of Mr.
Townsend, and done your best to console him for Catherine&rsquo;s
absence,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t ask you, and
you needn&rsquo;t deny it.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t put the
question to you for the world, and expose you to the
inconvenience of having to&mdash;a&mdash;excogitate an
answer.&nbsp; No one has betrayed you, and there has been no spy
upon your proceedings.&nbsp; Elizabeth has told no tales, and has
never mentioned you except to praise your good looks and good
spirits.&nbsp; The thing is simply an inference of my
own&mdash;an induction, as the philosophers say.&nbsp; It seems
to me likely that you would have offered an asylum to an
interesting sufferer.&nbsp; Mr. Townsend has been a good deal in
the house; there is something in the house that tells me
so.&nbsp; We doctors, you know, end by acquiring fine
perceptions, and it is impressed upon my sensorium that he has
sat in these chairs, in a very easy attitude, and warmed himself
at that fire.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t grudge him the comfort of it;
it is the only one he will ever enjoy at my expense.&nbsp; It
seems likely, indeed, that I shall be able to economise at his
own.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what you may have said to him, or
what you may say hereafter; but I should like you to know that if
you have encouraged him to believe that he will gain anything by
hanging on, or that I have budged a hair&rsquo;s-breadth from the
position I took up a year ago, you have played him a trick for
which he may exact reparation.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure that he
may not bring a suit against you.&nbsp; Of course you have done
it conscientiously; you have made yourself believe that I can be
tired out.&nbsp; This is the most baseless hallucination that
ever visited the brain of a genial optimist.&nbsp; I am not in
the least tired; I am as fresh as when I started; I am good for
fifty years yet.&nbsp; Catherine appears not to have budged an
inch either; she is equally fresh; so we are about where we were
before.&nbsp; This, however, you know as well as I.&nbsp; What I
wish is simply to give you notice of my own state of mind!&nbsp;
Take it to heart, dear Lavinia.&nbsp; Beware of the just
resentment of a deluded fortune-hunter!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say I expected it,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;And I had a sort of foolish hope that you
would come home without that odious ironical tone with which you
treat the most sacred subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t undervalue irony, it is often of great
use.&nbsp; It is not, however, always necessary, and I will show
you how gracefully I can lay it aside.&nbsp; I should like to
know whether you think Morris Townsend will hang on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will answer you with your own weapons,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;You had better wait and
see!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you call such a speech as that one of my own
weapons?&nbsp; I never said anything so rough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will hang on long enough to make you very
uncomfortable, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Lavinia,&rdquo; exclaimed the Doctor, &ldquo;do
you call that irony?&nbsp; I call it pugilism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, however, in spite of her pugilism, was a good
deal frightened, and she took counsel of her fears.&nbsp; Her
brother meanwhile took counsel, with many reservations, of Mrs.
Almond, to whom he was no less generous than to Lavinia, and a
good deal more communicative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose she has had him there all the while,&rdquo;
he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must look into the state of my
wine!&nbsp; You needn&rsquo;t mind telling me now; I have already
said all I mean to say to her on the subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he was in the house a good deal,&rdquo; Mrs.
Almond answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;But you must admit that your
leaving Lavinia quite alone was a great change for her, and that
it was natural she should want some society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do admit that, and that is why I shall make no row
about the wine; I shall set it down as compensation to
Lavinia.&nbsp; She is capable of telling me that she drank it all
herself.&nbsp; Think of the inconceivable bad taste, in the
circumstances, of that fellow making free with the house&mdash;or
coming there at all!&nbsp; If that doesn&rsquo;t describe him, he
is indescribable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His plan is to get what he can.&nbsp; Lavinia will have
supported him for a year,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so much gained.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will have to support him for the rest of his life,
then!&rdquo; cried the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;But without wine, as
they say at the <i>tables d&rsquo;h&ocirc;te</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catherine tells me he has set up a business, and is
making a great deal of money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor stared.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has not told me
that&mdash;and Lavinia didn&rsquo;t deign.&nbsp; Ah!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;Catherine has given me up.&nbsp; Not that it
matters, for all that the business amounts to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has not given up Mr. Townsend,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Almond.&nbsp; &ldquo;I saw that in the first half minute.&nbsp;
She has come home exactly the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly the same; not a grain more intelligent.&nbsp;
She didn&rsquo;t notice a stick or a stone all the while we were
away&mdash;not a picture nor a view, not a statue nor a
cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How could she notice?&nbsp; She had other things to
think of; they are never for an instant out of her mind.&nbsp;
She touches me very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She would touch me if she didn&rsquo;t irritate
me.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the effect she has upon me now.&nbsp; I
have tried everything upon her; I really have been quite
merciless.&nbsp; But it is of no use whatever; she is absolutely
<i>glued</i>.&nbsp; I have passed, in consequence, into the
exasperated stage.&nbsp; At first I had a good deal of a certain
genial curiosity about it; I wanted to see if she really would
stick.&nbsp; But, good Lord, one&rsquo;s curiosity is
satisfied!&nbsp; I see she is capable of it, and now she can let
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will never let go,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take care, or you will exasperate me too.&nbsp; If she
doesn&rsquo;t let go, she will be shaken off&mdash;sent tumbling
into the dust!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s a nice position for my
daughter.&nbsp; She can&rsquo;t see that if you are going to be
pushed you had better jump.&nbsp; And then she will complain of
her bruises.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will never complain,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I shall object to even more.&nbsp; But the deuce
will be that I can&rsquo;t prevent anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she is to have a fall,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond, with
a gentle laugh, &ldquo;we must spread as many carpets as we
can.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she carried out this idea by showing a
great deal of motherly kindness to the girl.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman immediately wrote to Morris Townsend.&nbsp; The
intimacy between these two was by this time consummate, but I
must content myself with noting but a few of its features.&nbsp;
Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s own share in it was a singular sentiment,
which might have been misinterpreted, but which in itself was not
discreditable to the poor lady.&nbsp; It was a romantic interest
in this attractive and unfortunate young man, and yet it was not
such an interest as Catherine might have been jealous of.&nbsp;
Mrs. Penniman had not a particle of jealousy of her niece.&nbsp;
For herself, she felt as if she were Morris&rsquo;s mother or
sister&mdash;a mother or sister of an emotional
temperament&mdash;and she had an absorbing desire to make him
comfortable and happy.&nbsp; She had striven to do so during the
year that her brother left her an open field, and her efforts had
been attended with the success that has been pointed out.&nbsp;
She had never had a child of her own, and Catherine, whom she had
done her best to invest with the importance that would naturally
belong to a youthful Penniman, had only partly rewarded her
zeal.&nbsp; Catherine, as an object of affection and solicitude,
had never had that picturesque charm which (as it seemed to her)
would have been a natural attribute of her own progeny.&nbsp;
Even the maternal passion in Mrs. Penniman would have been
romantic and factitious, and Catherine was not constituted to
inspire a romantic passion.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman was as fond of
her as ever, but she had grown to feel that with Catherine she
lacked opportunity.&nbsp; Sentimentally speaking, therefore, she
had (though she had not disinherited her niece) adopted Morris
Townsend, who gave her opportunity in abundance.&nbsp; She would
have been very happy to have a handsome and tyrannical son, and
would have taken an extreme interest in his love affairs.&nbsp;
This was the light in which she had come to regard Morris, who
had conciliated her at first, and made his impression by his
delicate and calculated deference&mdash;a sort of exhibition to
which Mrs. Penniman was particularly sensitive.&nbsp; He had
largely abated his deference afterwards, for he economised his
resources, but the impression was made, and the young man&rsquo;s
very brutality came to have a sort of filial value.&nbsp; If Mrs.
Penniman had had a son, she would probably have been afraid of
him, and at this stage of our narrative she was certainly afraid
of Morris Townsend.&nbsp; This was one of the results of his
domestication in Washington Square.&nbsp; He took his ease with
her&mdash;as, for that matter, he would certainly have done with
his own mother.</p>
<h2><a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>XXVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> letter was a word of warning;
it informed him that the Doctor had come home more impracticable
than ever.&nbsp; She might have reflected that Catherine would
supply him with all the information he needed on this point; but
we know that Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s reflexions were rarely just;
and, moreover, she felt that it was not for her to depend on what
Catherine might do.&nbsp; She was to do her duty, quite
irrespective of Catherine.&nbsp; I have said that her young
friend took his ease with her, and it is an illustration of the
fact that he made no answer to her letter.&nbsp; He took note of
it, amply; but he lighted his cigar with it, and he waited, in
tranquil confidence that he should receive another.&nbsp;
&ldquo;His state of mind really freezes my blood,&rdquo; Mrs.
Penniman had written, alluding to her brother; and it would have
seemed that upon this statement she could hardly improve.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, she wrote again, expressing herself with the aid of
a different figure.&nbsp; &ldquo;His hatred of you burns with a
lurid flame&mdash;the flame that never dies,&rdquo; she
wrote.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it doesn&rsquo;t light up the darkness of
your future.&nbsp; If my affection could do so, all the years of
your life would be an eternal sunshine.&nbsp; I can extract
nothing from C.; she is so terribly secretive, like her
father.&nbsp; She seems to expect to be married very soon, and
has evidently made preparations in Europe&mdash;quantities of
clothing, ten pairs of shoes, etc.&nbsp; My dear friend, you
cannot set up in married life simply with a few pairs of shoes,
can you?&nbsp; Tell me what you think of this.&nbsp; I am
intensely anxious to see you; I have so much to say.&nbsp; I miss
you dreadfully; the house seems so empty without you.&nbsp; What
is the news down town?&nbsp; Is the business extending?&nbsp;
That dear little business&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s so brave of
you!&nbsp; Couldn&rsquo;t I come to your office?&mdash;just for
three minutes?&nbsp; I might pass for a customer&mdash;is that
what you call them?&nbsp; I might come in to buy
something&mdash;some shares or some railroad things.&nbsp;
<i>Tell me what you think of this plan</i>.&nbsp; I would carry a
little reticule, like a woman of the people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In spite of the suggestion about the reticule, Morris appeared
to think poorly of the plan, for he gave Mrs. Penniman no
encouragement whatever to visit his office, which he had already
represented to her as a place peculiarly and unnaturally
difficult to find.&nbsp; But as she persisted in desiring an
interview&mdash;up to the last, after months of intimate
colloquy, she called these meetings
&ldquo;interviews&rdquo;&mdash;he agreed that they should take a
walk together, and was even kind enough to leave his office for
this purpose, during the hours at which business might have been
supposed to be liveliest.&nbsp; It was no surprise to him, when
they met at a street corner, in a region of empty lots and
undeveloped pavements (Mrs. Penniman being attired as much as
possible like a &ldquo;woman of the people&rdquo;), to find that,
in spite of her urgency, what she chiefly had to convey to him
was the assurance of her sympathy.&nbsp; Of such assurances,
however, he had already a voluminous collection, and it would not
have been worth his while to forsake a fruitful avocation merely
to hear Mrs. Penniman say, for the thousandth time, that she had
made his cause her own.&nbsp; Morris had something of his own to
say.&nbsp; It was not an easy thing to bring out, and while he
turned it over the difficulty made him acrimonious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, I know perfectly that he combines the
properties of a lump of ice and a red-hot coal,&rdquo; he
observed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Catherine has made it thoroughly clear,
and you have told me so till I am sick of it.&nbsp; You
needn&rsquo;t tell me again; I am perfectly satisfied.&nbsp; He
will never give us a penny; I regard that as mathematically
proved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman at this point had an inspiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you bring a lawsuit against
him?&rdquo;&nbsp; She wondered that this simple expedient had
never occurred to her before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will bring a lawsuit against <i>you</i>,&rdquo; said
Morris, &ldquo;if you ask me any more such aggravating
questions.&nbsp; A man should know when he is beaten,&rdquo; he
added, in a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;I must give her up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman received this declaration in silence, though it
made her heart beat a little.&nbsp; It found her by no means
unprepared, for she had accustomed herself to the thought that,
if Morris should decidedly not be able to get her brother&rsquo;s
money, it would not do for him to marry Catherine without
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would not do&rdquo; was a vague way of
putting the thing; but Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s natural affection
completed the idea, which, though it had not as yet been so
crudely expressed between them as in the form that Morris had
just given it, had nevertheless been implied so often, in certain
easy intervals of talk, as he sat stretching his legs in the
Doctor&rsquo;s well-stuffed armchairs, that she had grown first
to regard it with an emotion which she flattered herself was
philosophic, and then to have a secret tenderness for it.&nbsp;
The fact that she kept her tenderness secret proves, of course,
that she was ashamed of it; but she managed to blink her shame by
reminding herself that she was, after all, the official protector
of her niece&rsquo;s marriage.&nbsp; Her logic would scarcely
have passed muster with the Doctor.&nbsp; In the first place,
Morris <i>must</i> get the money, and she would help him to
it.&nbsp; In the second, it was plain it would never come to him,
and it would be a grievous pity he should marry without
it&mdash;a young man who might so easily find something
better.&nbsp; After her brother had delivered himself, on his
return from Europe, of that incisive little address that has been
quoted, Morris&rsquo;s cause seemed so hopeless that Mrs.
Penniman fixed her attention exclusively upon the latter branch
of her argument.&nbsp; If Morris had been her son, she would
certainly have sacrificed Catherine to a superior conception of
his future; and to be ready to do so as the case stood was
therefore even a finer degree of devotion.&nbsp; Nevertheless, it
checked her breath a little to have the sacrificial knife, as it
were, suddenly thrust into her hand.</p>
<p>Morris walked along a moment, and then he repeated harshly:
&ldquo;I must give her up!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I understand you,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman
gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly say it distinctly enough&mdash;brutally and
vulgarly enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was ashamed of himself, and his shame was uncomfortable;
and as he was extremely intolerant of discomfort, he felt vicious
and cruel.&nbsp; He wanted to abuse somebody, and he began,
cautiously&mdash;for he was always cautious&mdash;with
himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you take her down a little?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take her down?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prepare her&mdash;try and ease me off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman stopped, looking at him very solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor Morris, do you know how much she loves
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want to
know.&nbsp; I have always tried to keep from knowing.&nbsp; It
would be too painful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will suffer much,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must console her.&nbsp; If you are as good a friend
to me as you pretend to be, you will manage it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman shook her head sadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talk of my &lsquo;pretending&rsquo; to like you;
but I can&rsquo;t pretend to hate you.&nbsp; I can only tell her
I think very highly of you; and how will that console her for
losing you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Doctor will help you.&nbsp; He will be delighted at
the thing being broken off, and, as he is a knowing fellow, he
will invent something to comfort her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will invent a new torture!&rdquo; cried Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Heaven deliver her from her father&rsquo;s
comfort.&nbsp; It will consist of his crowing over her and
saying, &lsquo;I always told you so!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris coloured a most uncomfortable red.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you don&rsquo;t console her any better than you
console me, you certainly won&rsquo;t be of much use!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s a damned disagreeable necessity; I feel it extremely,
and you ought to make it easy for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will be your friend for life!&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be my friend <i>now</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Morris walked
on.</p>
<p>She went with him; she was almost trembling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you like me to tell her?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t tell her, but you can&mdash;you
can&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And he hesitated, trying to think what
Mrs. Penniman could do.&nbsp; &ldquo;You can explain to her why
it is.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s because I can&rsquo;t bring myself to
step in between her and her father&mdash;to give him the pretext
he grasps at&mdash;so eagerly (it&rsquo;s a hideous sight) for
depriving her of her rights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman felt with remarkable promptitude the charm of
this formula.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so like you,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s so finely felt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris gave his stick an angry swing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, botheration!&rdquo; he exclaimed perversely.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, however, was not discouraged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It may turn out better than you think.&nbsp; Catherine
is, after all, so very peculiar.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she thought she
might take it upon herself to assure him that, whatever happened,
the girl would be very quiet&mdash;she wouldn&rsquo;t make a
noise.&nbsp; They extended their walk, and, while they proceeded,
Mrs. Penniman took upon herself other things besides, and ended
by having assumed a considerable burden; Morris being ready
enough, as may be imagined, to put everything off upon her.&nbsp;
But he was not for a single instant the dupe of her blundering
alacrity; he knew that of what she promised she was competent to
perform but an insignificant fraction, and the more she professed
her willingness to serve him, the greater fool he thought
her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What will you do if you don&rsquo;t marry her?&rdquo;
she ventured to inquire in the course of this conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something brilliant,&rdquo; said Morris.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t you like me to do something
brilliant?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea gave Mrs. Penniman exceeding pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall feel sadly taken in if you
don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall have to, to make up for this.&nbsp; This
isn&rsquo;t at all brilliant, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman mused a little, as if there might be some way of
making out that it was; but she had to give up the attempt, and,
to carry off the awkwardness of failure, she risked a new
inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;do you mean another
marriage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris greeted this question with a reflexion which was hardly
the less impudent from being inaudible.&nbsp; &ldquo;Surely,
women are more crude than men!&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he answered
audibly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never in the world!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman felt disappointed and snubbed, and she relieved
herself in a little vaguely-sarcastic cry.&nbsp; He was certainly
perverse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give her up, not for another woman, but for a wider
career!&rdquo; Morris announced.</p>
<p>This was very grand; but still Mrs. Penniman, who felt that
she had exposed herself, was faintly rancorous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean never to come to see her again?&rdquo; she
asked, with some sharpness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, I shall come again; but what is the use of
dragging it out?&nbsp; I have been four times since she came
back, and it&rsquo;s terribly awkward work.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
keep it up indefinitely; she oughtn&rsquo;t to expect that, you
know.&nbsp; A woman should never keep a man dangling!&rdquo; he
added finely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but you must have your last parting!&rdquo; urged
his companion, in whose imagination the idea of last partings
occupied a place inferior in dignity only to that of first
meetings.</p>
<h2><a name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
185</span>XXIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">He</span> came again, without managing the
last parting; and again and again, without finding that Mrs.
Penniman had as yet done much to pave the path of retreat with
flowers.&nbsp; It was devilish awkward, as he said, and he felt a
lively animosity for Catherine&rsquo;s aunt, who, as he had now
quite formed the habit of saying to himself, had dragged him into
the mess and was bound in common charity to get him out of
it.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman, to tell the truth, had, in the seclusion
of her own apartment&mdash;and, I may add, amid the
suggestiveness of Catherine&rsquo;s, which wore in those days the
appearance of that of a young lady laying out her
<i>trousseau</i>&mdash;Mrs. Penniman had measured her
responsibilities, and taken fright at their magnitude.&nbsp; The
task of preparing Catherine and easing off Morris presented
difficulties which increased in the execution, and even led the
impulsive Lavinia to ask herself whether the modification of the
young man&rsquo;s original project had been conceived in a happy
spirit.&nbsp; A brilliant future, a wider career, a conscience
exempt from the reproach of interference between a young lady and
her natural rights&mdash;these excellent things might be too
troublesomely purchased.&nbsp; From Catherine herself Mrs.
Penniman received no assistance whatever; the poor girl was
apparently without suspicion of her danger.&nbsp; She looked at
her lover with eyes of undiminished trust, and though she had
less confidence in her aunt than in a young man with whom she had
exchanged so many tender vows, she gave her no handle for
explaining or confessing.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman, faltering and
wavering, declared Catherine was very stupid, put off the great
scene, as she would have called it, from day to day, and wandered
about very uncomfortably, primed, to repletion, with her apology,
but unable to bring it to the light.&nbsp; Morris&rsquo;s own
scenes were very small ones just now; but even these were beyond
his strength.&nbsp; He made his visits as brief as possible, and
while he sat with his mistress, found terribly little to talk
about.&nbsp; She was waiting for him, in vulgar parlance, to name
the day; and so long as he was unprepared to be explicit on this
point it seemed a mockery to pretend to talk about matters more
abstract.&nbsp; She had no airs and no arts; she never attempted
to disguise her expectancy.&nbsp; She was waiting on his good
pleasure, and would wait modestly and patiently; his hanging back
at this supreme time might appear strange, but of course he must
have a good reason for it.&nbsp; Catherine would have made a wife
of the gentle old-fashioned pattern&mdash;regarding reasons as
favours and windfalls, but no more expecting one every day than
she would have expected a bouquet of camellias.&nbsp; During the
period of her engagement, however, a young lady even of the most
slender pretensions counts upon more bouquets than at other
times; and there was a want of perfume in the air at this moment
which at last excited the girl&rsquo;s alarm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sick?&rdquo; she asked of Morris.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You seem so restless, and you look pale.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not at all well,&rdquo; said Morris; and it
occurred to him that, if he could only make her pity him enough,
he might get off.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are overworked; you oughtn&rsquo;t to
work so much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must do that.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then he added, with a
sort of calculated brutality, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to owe
you everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, how can you say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am too proud,&rdquo; said Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;you are too proud!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you must take me as I am,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;you can never change me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to change you,&rdquo; she said
gently.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will take you as you are!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
she stood looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know people talk tremendously about a man&rsquo;s
marrying a rich girl,&rdquo; Morris remarked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s excessively disagreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am not rich?&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are rich enough to make me talked about!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you are talked about.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s an
honour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an honour I could easily dispense
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was on the point of asking him whether it were not a
compensation for this annoyance that the poor girl who had the
misfortune to bring it upon him, loved him so dearly and believed
in him so truly; but she hesitated, thinking that this would
perhaps seem an exacting speech, and while she hesitated, he
suddenly left her.</p>
<p>The next time he came, however, she brought it out, and she
told him again that he was too proud.&nbsp; He repeated that he
couldn&rsquo;t change, and this time she felt the impulse to say
that with a little effort he might change.</p>
<p>Sometimes he thought that if he could only make a quarrel with
her it might help him; but the question was how to quarrel with a
young woman who had such treasures of concession.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose you think the effort is all on your side!&rdquo; he was
reduced to exclaiming.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe that
I have my own effort to make?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all yours now,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My effort is finished and done with!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, mine is not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must bear things together,&rdquo; said
Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we ought to
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris attempted a natural smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are some
things which we can&rsquo;t very well bear together&mdash;for
instance, separation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you speak of separation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! you don&rsquo;t like it; I knew you
wouldn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, Morris?&rdquo; she suddenly
asked.</p>
<p>He fixed his eye on her for a moment, and for a part of that
moment she was afraid of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will you promise not to
make a scene?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A scene!&mdash;do I make scenes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All women do!&rdquo; said Morris, with the tone of
large experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t.&nbsp; Where are you going?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I should say I was going away on business, should
you think it very strange?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wondered a moment, gazing at him.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;no.&nbsp; Not if you will take me with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take you with me&mdash;on business?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your business?&nbsp; Your business is to be
with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t earn my living with you,&rdquo; said
Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or rather,&rdquo; he cried with a sudden
inspiration, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just what I do&mdash;or what the
world says I do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This ought perhaps to have been a great stroke, but it
miscarried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where are you going?&rdquo; Catherine
simply repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To New Orleans.&nbsp; About buying some
cotton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am perfectly willing to go to New
Orleans.&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose I would take you to a nest of yellow
fever?&rdquo; cried Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you suppose I would
expose you at such a time as this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If there is yellow fever, why should you go?&nbsp;
Morris, you must not go!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is to make six thousand dollars,&rdquo; said
Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you grudge me that
satisfaction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have no need of six thousand dollars.&nbsp; You
think too much about money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can afford to say that?&nbsp; This is a great
chance; we heard of it last night.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he explained
to her in what the chance consisted; and told her a long story,
going over more than once several of the details, about the
remarkable stroke of business which he and his partner had
planned between them.</p>
<p>But Catherine&rsquo;s imagination, for reasons best known to
herself, absolutely refused to be fired.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you can
go to New Orleans, I can go,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why
shouldn&rsquo;t you catch yellow fever quite as easily as
I?&nbsp; I am every bit as strong as you, and not in the least
afraid of any fever.&nbsp; When we were in Europe, we were in
very unhealthy places; my father used to make me take some
pills.&nbsp; I never caught anything, and I never was
nervous.&nbsp; What will be the use of six thousand dollars if
you die of a fever?&nbsp; When persons are going to be married
they oughtn&rsquo;t to think so much about business.&nbsp; You
shouldn&rsquo;t think about cotton, you should think about
me.&nbsp; You can go to New Orleans some other time&mdash;there
will always be plenty of cotton.&nbsp; It isn&rsquo;t the moment
to choose&mdash;we have waited too long already.&rdquo;&nbsp; She
spoke more forcibly and volubly than he had ever heard her, and
she held his arm in her two hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said you wouldn&rsquo;t make a scene!&rdquo; cried
Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;I call this a scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you that are making it!&nbsp; I have never
asked you anything before.&nbsp; We have waited too long
already.&rdquo;&nbsp; And it was a comfort to her to think that
she had hitherto asked so little; it seemed to make her right to
insist the greater now.</p>
<p>Morris bethought himself a little.&nbsp; &ldquo;Very well,
then; we won&rsquo;t talk about it any more.&nbsp; I will
transact my business by letter.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he began to
smooth his hat, as if to take leave.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t go?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she stood looking
up at him.</p>
<p>He could not give up his idea of provoking a quarrel; it was
so much the simplest way!&nbsp; He bent his eyes on her upturned
face, with the darkest frown he could achieve.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are not discreet.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t bully me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But, as usual, she conceded everything.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, I am
not discreet; I know I am too pressing.&nbsp; But isn&rsquo;t it
natural?&nbsp; It is only for a moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment you may do a great deal of harm.&nbsp; Try
and be calmer the next time I come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will you come?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to make conditions?&rdquo; Morris
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will come next Saturday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to-morrow,&rdquo; Catherine begged; &ldquo;I want
you to come to-morrow.&nbsp; I will be very quiet,&rdquo; she
added; and her agitation had by this time become so great that
the assurance was not becoming.&nbsp; A sudden fear had come over
her; it was like the solid conjunction of a dozen disembodied
doubts, and her imagination, at a single bound, had traversed an
enormous distance.&nbsp; All her being, for the moment, centred
in the wish to keep him in the room.</p>
<p>Morris bent his head and kissed her forehead.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When you are quiet, you are perfection,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;but when you are violent, you are not in
character.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Catherine&rsquo;s wish that there should be no violence
about her save the beating of her heart, which she could not
help; and she went on, as gently as possible, &ldquo;Will you
promise to come to-morrow?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said Saturday!&rdquo; Morris answered, smiling.&nbsp;
He tried a frown at one moment, a smile at another; he was at his
wit&rsquo;s end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Saturday too,&rdquo; she answered, trying to
smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;But to-morrow first.&rdquo;&nbsp; He was
going to the door, and she went with him quickly.&nbsp; She
leaned her shoulder against it; it seemed to her that she would
do anything to keep him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I am prevented from coming to-morrow, you will say I
have deceived you!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you be prevented?&nbsp; You can come if you
will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a busy man&mdash;I am not a dangler!&rdquo; cried
Morris sternly.</p>
<p>His voice was so hard and unnatural that, with a helpless look
at him, she turned away; and then he quickly laid his hand on the
door-knob.&nbsp; He felt as if he were absolutely running away
from her.&nbsp; But in an instant she was close to him again, and
murmuring in a tone none the less penetrating for being low,
&ldquo;Morris, you are going to leave me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, for a little while.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For how long?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Till you are reasonable again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never be reasonable in that way!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And she tried to keep him longer; it was almost a struggle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Think of what I have done!&rdquo; she broke out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Morris, I have given up everything!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall have everything back!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t say that if you didn&rsquo;t mean
something.&nbsp; What is it?&mdash;what has happened?&mdash;what
have I done?&mdash;what has changed you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will write to you&mdash;that is better,&rdquo; Morris
stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you won&rsquo;t come back!&rdquo; she cried,
bursting into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear Catherine,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t
believe that I promise you that you shall see me
again!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he managed to get away and to close the
door behind him.</p>
<h2><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>XXX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was almost her last outbreak of
passive grief; at least, she never indulged in another that the
world knew anything about.&nbsp; But this one was long and
terrible; she flung herself on the sofa and gave herself up to
her misery.&nbsp; She hardly knew what had happened; ostensibly
she had only had a difference with her lover, as other girls had
had before, and the thing was not only not a rupture, but she was
under no obligation to regard it even as a menace.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, she felt a wound, even if he had not dealt it; it
seemed to her that a mask had suddenly fallen from his
face.&nbsp; He had wished to get away from her; he had been angry
and cruel, and said strange things, with strange looks.&nbsp; She
was smothered and stunned; she buried her head in the cushions,
sobbing and talking to herself.&nbsp; But at last she raised
herself, with the fear that either her father or Mrs. Penniman
would come in; and then she sat there, staring before her, while
the room grew darker.&nbsp; She said to herself that perhaps he
would come back to tell her he had not meant what he said; and
she listened for his ring at the door, trying to believe that
this was probable.&nbsp; A long time passed, but Morris remained
absent; the shadows gathered; the evening settled down on the
meagre elegance of the light, clear-coloured room; the fire went
out.&nbsp; When it had grown dark, Catherine went to the window
and looked out; she stood there for half an hour, on the mere
chance that he would come up the steps.&nbsp; At last she turned
away, for she saw her father come in.&nbsp; He had seen her at
the window looking out, and he stopped a moment at the bottom of
the white steps, and gravely, with an air of exaggerated
courtesy, lifted his hat to her.&nbsp; The gesture was so
incongruous to the condition she was in, this stately tribute of
respect to a poor girl despised and forsaken was so out of place,
that the thing gave her a kind of horror, and she hurried away to
her room.&nbsp; It seemed to her that she had given Morris
up.</p>
<p>She had to show herself half an hour later, and she was
sustained at table by the immensity of her desire that her father
should not perceive that anything had happened.&nbsp; This was a
great help to her afterwards, and it served her (though never as
much as she supposed) from the first.&nbsp; On this occasion Dr.
Sloper was rather talkative.&nbsp; He told a great many stories
about a wonderful poodle that he had seen at the house of an old
lady whom he visited professionally.&nbsp; Catherine not only
tried to appear to listen to the anecdotes of the poodle, but she
endeavoured to interest herself in them, so as not to think of
her scene with Morris.&nbsp; That perhaps was an hallucination;
he was mistaken, she was jealous; people didn&rsquo;t change like
that from one day to another.&nbsp; Then she knew that she had
had doubts before&mdash;strange suspicions, that were at once
vague and acute&mdash;and that he had been different ever since
her return from Europe: whereupon she tried again to listen to
her father, who told a story so remarkably well.&nbsp; Afterwards
she went straight to her own room; it was beyond her strength to
undertake to spend the evening with her aunt.&nbsp; All the
evening, alone, she questioned herself.&nbsp; Her trouble was
terrible; but was it a thing of her imagination, engendered by an
extravagant sensibility, or did it represent a clear-cut reality,
and had the worst that was possible actually come to pass?&nbsp;
Mrs. Penniman, with a degree of tact that was as unusual as it
was commendable, took the line of leaving her alone.&nbsp; The
truth is, that her suspicions having been aroused, she indulged a
desire, natural to a timid person, that the explosion should be
localised.&nbsp; So long as the air still vibrated she kept out
of the way.</p>
<p>She passed and repassed Catherine&rsquo;s door several times
in the course of the evening, as if she expected to hear a
plaintive moan behind it.&nbsp; But the room remained perfectly
still; and accordingly, the last thing before retiring to her own
couch, she applied for admittance.&nbsp; Catherine was sitting
up, and had a book that she pretended to be reading.&nbsp; She
had no wish to go to bed, for she had no expectation of
sleeping.&nbsp; After Mrs. Penniman had left her she sat up half
the night, and she offered her visitor no inducement to
remain.&nbsp; Her aunt came stealing in very gently, and
approached her with great solemnity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid you are in trouble, my dear.&nbsp; Can I do
anything to help you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not in any trouble whatever, and do not need any
help,&rdquo; said Catherine, fibbing roundly, and proving thereby
that not only our faults, but our most involuntary misfortunes,
tend to corrupt our morals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has nothing happened to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing whatever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you very sure, dear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And can I really do nothing for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, aunt, but kindly leave me alone,&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, though she had been afraid of too warm a
welcome before, was now disappointed at so cold a one; and in
relating afterwards, as she did to many persons, and with
considerable variations of detail, the history of the termination
of her niece&rsquo;s engagement, she was usually careful to
mention that the young lady, on a certain occasion, had
&ldquo;hustled&rdquo; her out of the room.&nbsp; It was
characteristic of Mrs. Penniman that she related this fact, not
in the least out of malignity to Catherine, whom she very
sufficiently pitied, but simply from a natural disposition to
embellish any subject that she touched.</p>
<p>Catherine, as I have said, sat up half the night, as if she
still expected to hear Morris Townsend ring at the door.&nbsp; On
the morrow this expectation was less unreasonable; but it was not
gratified by the reappearance of the young man.&nbsp; Neither had
he written; there was not a word of explanation or
reassurance.&nbsp; Fortunately for Catherine she could take
refuge from her excitement, which had now become intense, in her
determination that her father should see nothing of it.&nbsp; How
well she deceived her father we shall have occasion to learn; but
her innocent arts were of little avail before a person of the
rare perspicacity of Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp; This lady easily saw
that she was agitated, and if there was any agitation going
forward, Mrs. Penniman was not a person to forfeit her natural
share in it.&nbsp; She returned to the charge the next evening,
and requested her niece to lean upon her&mdash;to unburden her
heart.&nbsp; Perhaps she should be able to explain certain things
that now seemed dark, and that she knew more about than Catherine
supposed.&nbsp; If Catherine had been frigid the night before,
to-day she was haughty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are completely mistaken, and I have not the least
idea what you mean.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know what you are trying
to fasten on me, and I have never had less need of any
one&rsquo;s explanations in my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this way the girl delivered herself, and from hour to hour
kept her aunt at bay.&nbsp; From hour to hour Mrs.
Penniman&rsquo;s curiosity grew.&nbsp; She would have given her
little finger to know what Morris had said and done, what tone he
had taken, what pretext he had found.&nbsp; She wrote to him,
naturally, to request an interview; but she received, as
naturally, no answer to her petition.&nbsp; Morris was not in a
writing mood; for Catherine had addressed him two short notes
which met with no acknowledgment.&nbsp; These notes were so brief
that I may give them entire.&nbsp; &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you give me
some sign that you didn&rsquo;t mean to be so cruel as you seemed
on Tuesday?&rdquo;&mdash;that was the first; the other was a
little longer.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I was unreasonable or suspicious
on Tuesday&mdash;if I annoyed you or troubled you in any
way&mdash;I beg your forgiveness, and I promise never again to be
so foolish.&nbsp; I am punished enough, and I don&rsquo;t
understand.&nbsp; Dear Morris, you are killing me!&rdquo;&nbsp;
These notes were despatched on the Friday and Saturday; but
Saturday and Sunday passed without bringing the poor girl the
satisfaction she desired.&nbsp; Her punishment accumulated; she
continued to bear it, however, with a good deal of superficial
fortitude.&nbsp; On Saturday morning the Doctor, who had been
watching in silence, spoke to his sister Lavinia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing has happened&mdash;the scoundrel has backed
out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Penniman, who had bethought
herself what she should say to Catherine, but was not provided
with a line of defence against her brother, so that indignant
negation was the only weapon in her hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has begged for a reprieve, then, if you like that
better!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to make you very happy that your
daughter&rsquo;s affections have been trifled with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; said the Doctor; &lsquo;&ldquo;for I
had foretold it!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a great pleasure to be in the
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your pleasures make one shudder!&rdquo; his sister
exclaimed.</p>
<p>Catherine went rigidly through her usual occupations; that is,
up to the point of going with her aunt to church on Sunday
morning.&nbsp; She generally went to afternoon service as well;
but on this occasion her courage faltered, and she begged of Mrs.
Penniman to go without her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you have a secret,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman,
with great significance, looking at her rather grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I have, I shall keep it!&rdquo; Catherine answered,
turning away.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman started for church; but before she had arrived,
she stopped and turned back, and before twenty minutes had
elapsed she re-entered the house, looked into the empty parlours,
and then went upstairs and knocked at Catherine&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; She got no answer; Catherine was not in her room, and
Mrs. Penniman presently ascertained that she was not in the
house.&nbsp; &ldquo;She has gone to him, she has fled!&rdquo;
Lavinia cried, clasping her hands with admiration and envy.&nbsp;
But she soon perceived that Catherine had taken nothing with
her&mdash;all her personal property in her room was
intact&mdash;and then she jumped at the hypothesis that the girl
had gone forth, not in tenderness, but in resentment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She has followed him to his own door&mdash;she has burst
upon him in his own apartment!&rdquo;&nbsp; It was in these terms
that Mrs. Penniman depicted to herself her niece&rsquo;s errand,
which, viewed in this light, gratified her sense of the
picturesque only a shade less strongly than the idea of a
clandestine marriage.&nbsp; To visit one&rsquo;s lover, with
tears and reproaches, at his own residence, was an image so
agreeable to Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s mind that she felt a sort of
&aelig;sthetic disappointment at its lacking, in this case, the
harmonious accompaniments of darkness and storm.&nbsp; A quiet
Sunday afternoon appeared an inadequate setting for it; and,
indeed, Mrs. Penniman was quite out of humour with the conditions
of the time, which passed very slowly as she sat in the front
parlour in her bonnet and her cashmere shawl, awaiting
Catherine&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>This event at last took place.&nbsp; She saw her&mdash;at the
window&mdash;mount the steps, and she went to await her in the
hall, where she pounced upon her as soon as she had entered the
house, and drew her into the parlour, closing the door with
solemnity.&nbsp; Catherine was flushed, and her eye was
bright.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman hardly knew what to think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I venture to ask where you have been?&rdquo; she
demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been to take a walk,&rdquo; said
Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you had gone to
church.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did go to church; but the service was shorter than
usual.&nbsp; And pray, where did you walk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your ignorance is most extraordinary!&nbsp; Dear
Catherine, you can trust me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I to trust you with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With your secret&mdash;your sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no sorrow!&rdquo; said Catherine fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman insisted,
&ldquo;you can&rsquo;t deceive me.&nbsp; I know everything.&nbsp;
I have been requested to&mdash;a&mdash;to converse with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to converse!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will relieve you.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know
Shakespeare&rsquo;s lines?&mdash;&lsquo;the grief that does not
speak!&rsquo;&nbsp; My dear girl, it is better as it
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is better?&rdquo; Catherine asked.</p>
<p>She was really too perverse.&nbsp; A certain amount of
perversity was to be allowed for in a young lady whose lover had
thrown her over; but not such an amount as would prove
inconvenient to his apologists.&nbsp; &ldquo;That you should be
reasonable,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, with some sternness.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That you should take counsel of worldly prudence, and
submit to practical considerations.&nbsp; That you should agree
to&mdash;a&mdash;separate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine had been ice up to this moment, but at this word she
flamed up.&nbsp; &ldquo;Separate?&nbsp; What do you know about
our separating?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman shook her head with a sadness in which there was
almost a sense of injury.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your pride is my pride,
and your susceptibilities are mine.&nbsp; I see your side
perfectly, but I also&rdquo;&mdash;and she smiled with melancholy
suggestiveness&mdash;&ldquo;I also see the situation as a
whole!&rdquo;</p>
<p>This suggestiveness was lost upon Catherine, who repeated her
violent inquiry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you talk about separation;
what do you know about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must study resignation,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman,
hesitating, but sententious at a venture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resignation to what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To a change of&mdash;of our plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My plans have not changed!&rdquo; said Catherine, with
a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but Mr. Townsend&rsquo;s have,&rdquo; her aunt
answered very gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was an imperious brevity in the tone of this inquiry,
against which Mrs. Penniman felt bound to protest; the
information with which she had undertaken to supply her niece
was, after all, a favour.&nbsp; She had tried sharpness, and she
had tried sternness: but neither would do; she was shocked at the
girl&rsquo;s obstinacy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;if he hasn&rsquo;t told you! . . . &rdquo; and she turned
away.</p>
<p>Catherine watched her a moment in silence; then she hurried
after her, stopping her before she reached the door.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Told me what?&nbsp; What do you mean?&nbsp; What are you
hinting at and threatening me with?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it broken off?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Penniman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My engagement?&nbsp; Not in the least!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon in that case.&nbsp; I have spoken too
soon!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Too soon!&nbsp; Soon or late,&rdquo; Catherine broke
out, &ldquo;you speak foolishly and cruelly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has happened between you, then?&rdquo; asked her
aunt, struck by the sincerity of this cry.&nbsp; &ldquo;For
something certainly has happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing has happened but that I love him more and
more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was silent an instant.&nbsp; &ldquo;I suppose
that&rsquo;s the reason you went to see him this
afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine flushed as if she had been struck.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,
I did go to see him!&nbsp; But that&rsquo;s my own
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; we won&rsquo;t talk about
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Penniman moved towards the door
again.&nbsp; But she was stopped by a sudden imploring cry from
the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Lavinia, <i>where</i> has he gone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you admit, then, that he has gone away?&nbsp;
Didn&rsquo;t they know at his house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said he had left town.&nbsp; I asked no more
questions; I was ashamed,&rdquo; said Catherine, simply
enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t have taken so compromising a step if
you had had a little more confidence in me,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman
observed, with a good deal of grandeur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to New Orleans?&rdquo; Catherine went on
irrelevantly.</p>
<p>It was the first time Mrs. Penniman had heard of New Orleans
in this connexion; but she was averse to letting Catherine know
that she was in the dark.&nbsp; She attempted to strike an
illumination from the instructions she had received from
Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;My dear Catherine,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;when a separation has been agreed upon, the farther he
goes away the better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed upon?&nbsp; Has he agreed upon it with
you?&rdquo;&nbsp; A consummate sense of her aunt&rsquo;s
meddlesome folly had come over her during the last five minutes,
and she was sickened at the thought that Mrs. Penniman had been
let loose, as it were, upon her happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He certainly has sometimes advised with me,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Penniman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, then, that have changed him and made him so
unnatural?&rdquo; Catherine cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it you that
have worked on him and taken him from me?&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t
belong to you, and I don&rsquo;t see how you have anything to do
with what is between us!&nbsp; Is it you that have made this plot
and told him to leave me?&nbsp; How could you be so wicked, so
cruel?&nbsp; What have I ever done to you; why can&rsquo;t you
leave me alone?&nbsp; I was afraid you would spoil everything;
for you <i>do</i> spoil everything you touch; I was afraid of you
all the time we were abroad; I had no rest when I thought that
you were always talking to him.&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine went on
with growing vehemence, pouring out in her bitterness and in the
clairvoyance of her passion (which suddenly, jumping all
processes, made her judge her aunt finally and without appeal)
the uneasiness which had lain for so many months upon her
heart.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman was scared and bewildered; she saw no prospect
of introducing her little account of the purity of Morris&rsquo;s
motives.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a most ungrateful girl!&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you scold me for talking with him?&nbsp; I
am sure we never talked of anything but you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and that was the way you worried him; you made him
tired of my very name!&nbsp; I wish you had never spoken of me to
him; I never asked your help!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure if it hadn&rsquo;t been for me he would never
have come to the house, and you would never have known what he
thought of you,&rdquo; Mrs. Penniman rejoined, with a good deal
of justice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish he never had come to the house, and that I never
had known it!&nbsp; That&rsquo;s better than this,&rdquo; said
poor Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very ungrateful girl,&rdquo; Aunt Lavinia
repeated.</p>
<p>Catherine&rsquo;s outbreak of anger and the sense of wrong
gave her, while they lasted, the satisfaction that comes from all
assertion of force; they hurried her along, and there is always a
sort of pleasure in cleaving the air.&nbsp; But at the bottom she
hated to be violent, and she was conscious of no aptitude for
organised resentment.&nbsp; She calmed herself with a great
effort, but with great rapidity, and walked about the room a few
moments, trying to say to herself that her aunt had meant
everything for the best.&nbsp; She did not succeed in saying it
with much conviction, but after a little she was able to speak
quietly enough.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not ungrateful, but I am very unhappy.&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s hard to be grateful for that,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you please tell me where he is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea; I am not in secret
correspondence with him!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Mrs. Penniman wished
indeed that she were, so that she might let him know how
Catherine abused her, after all she had done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it a plan of his, then, to break
off&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; By this time Catherine had become
completely quiet.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman began again to have a glimpse of her chance for
explaining.&nbsp; &ldquo;He shrank&mdash;he shrank,&rdquo; she
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He lacked courage, but it was the courage to
injure you!&nbsp; He couldn&rsquo;t bear to bring down on you
your father&rsquo;s curse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine listened to this with her eyes fixed upon her aunt,
and continued to gaze at her for some time afterwards.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Did he tell you to say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me to say many things&mdash;all so delicate, so
discriminating.&nbsp; And he told me to tell you he hoped you
wouldn&rsquo;t despise him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Catherine.&nbsp; And then
she added: &ldquo;And will he stay away for ever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, for ever is a long time.&nbsp; Your father,
perhaps, won&rsquo;t live for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure you appreciate&mdash;you
understand&mdash;even though your heart bleeds,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;You doubtless think him too
scrupulous.&nbsp; So do I, but I respect his scruples.&nbsp; What
he asks of you is that you should do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine was still gazing at her aunt, but she spoke at last,
as if she had not heard or not understood her.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
has been a regular plan, then.&nbsp; He has broken it off
deliberately; he has given me up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the present, dear Catherine.&nbsp; He has put it
off only.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has left me alone,&rdquo; Catherine went on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you <i>me</i>?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Penniman, with much expression.</p>
<p>Catherine shook her head slowly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
believe it!&rdquo; and she left the room.</p>
<h2><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>XXXI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Though</span> she had forced herself to be
calm, she preferred practising this virtue in private, and she
forbore to show herself at tea&mdash;a repast which, on Sundays,
at six o&rsquo;clock, took the place of dinner.&nbsp; Dr. Sloper
and his sister sat face to face, but Mrs. Penniman never met her
brother&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; Late in the evening she went with him,
but without Catherine, to their sister Almond&rsquo;s, where,
between the two ladies, Catherine&rsquo;s unhappy situation was
discussed with a frankness that was conditioned by a good deal of
mysterious reticence on Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am delighted he is not to marry her,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Almond, &ldquo;but he ought to be horsewhipped all the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, who was shocked at her sister&rsquo;s
coarseness, replied that he had been actuated by the noblest of
motives&mdash;the desire not to impoverish Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very happy that Catherine is not to be
impoverished&mdash;but I hope he may never have a penny too
much!&nbsp; And what does the poor girl say to <i>you</i>?&rdquo;
Mrs. Almond asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She says I have a genius for consolation,&rdquo; said
Mrs. Penniman.</p>
<p>This was the account of the matter that she gave to her
sister, and it was perhaps with the consciousness of genius that,
on her return that evening to Washington Square, she again
presented herself for admittance at Catherine&rsquo;s door.&nbsp;
Catherine came and opened it; she was apparently very quiet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I only want to give you a little word of advice,&rdquo;
she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your father asks you, say that
everything is going on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine stood there, with her hand on the knob looking at
her aunt, but not asking her to come in.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you
think he will ask me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sure he will.&nbsp; He asked me just now, on our
way home from your Aunt Elizabeth&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I explained the
whole thing to your Aunt Elizabeth.&nbsp; I said to your father I
know nothing about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he will ask me when he sees&mdash;when he
sees&mdash;?&rdquo;&nbsp; But here Catherine stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more he sees the more disagreeable he will
be,&rdquo; said her aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He shall see as little as possible!&rdquo; Catherine
declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell him you are to be married.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I am,&rdquo; said Catherine softly; and she closed
the door upon her aunt.</p>
<p>She could not have said this two days later&mdash;for
instance, on Tuesday, when she at last received a letter from
Morris Townsend.&nbsp; It was an epistle of considerable length,
measuring five large square pages, and written at
Philadelphia.&nbsp; It was an explanatory document, and it
explained a great many things, chief among which were the
considerations that had led the writer to take advantage of an
urgent &ldquo;professional&rdquo; absence to try and banish from
his mind the image of one whose path he had crossed only to
scatter it with ruins.&nbsp; He ventured to expect but partial
success in this attempt, but he could promise her that, whatever
his failure, he would never again interpose between her generous
heart and her brilliant prospects and filial duties.&nbsp; He
closed with an intimation that his professional pursuits might
compel him to travel for some months, and with the hope that when
they should each have accommodated themselves to what was sternly
involved in their respective positions&mdash;even should this
result not be reached for years&mdash;they should meet as
friends, as fellow-sufferers, as innocent but philosophic victims
of a great social law.&nbsp; That her life should be peaceful and
happy was the dearest wish of him who ventured still to subscribe
himself her most obedient servant.&nbsp; The letter was
beautifully written, and Catherine, who kept it for many years
after this, was able, when her sense of the bitterness of its
meaning and the hollowness of its tone had grown less acute, to
admire its grace of expression.&nbsp; At present, for a long time
after she received it, all she had to help her was the
determination, daily more rigid, to make no appeal to the
compassion of her father.</p>
<p>He suffered a week to elapse, and then one day, in the
morning, at an hour at which she rarely saw him, he strolled into
the back parlour.&nbsp; He had watched his time, and he found her
alone.&nbsp; She was sitting with some work, and he came and
stood in front of her.&nbsp; He was going out, he had on his hat
and was drawing on his gloves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem to me that you are treating me
just now with all the consideration I deserve,&rdquo; he said in
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I have done,&rdquo; Catherine
answered, with her eyes on her work.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have apparently quite banished from your mind the
request I made you at Liverpool, before we sailed; the request
that you would notify me in advance before leaving my
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not left your house!&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you intend to leave it, and by what you gave me to
understand, your departure must be impending.&nbsp; In fact,
though you are still here in body, you are already absent in
spirit.&nbsp; Your mind has taken up its residence with your
prospective husband, and you might quite as well be lodged under
the conjugal roof, for all the benefit we get from your
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will try and be more cheerful!&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You certainly ought to be cheerful, you ask a great
deal if you are not.&nbsp; To the pleasure of marrying a
brilliant young man, you add that of having your own way; you
strike me as a very lucky young lady!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine got up; she was suffocating.&nbsp; But she folded
her work, deliberately and correctly, bending her burning face
upon it.&nbsp; Her father stood where he had planted himself; she
hoped he would go, but he smoothed and buttoned his gloves, and
then he rested his hands upon his hips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a convenience to me to know when I may
expect to have an empty house,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When you go, your aunt marches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at him at last, with a long silent gaze, which, in
spite of her pride and her resolution, uttered part of the appeal
she had tried not to make.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s cold grey eye
sounded her own, and he insisted on his point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to-morrow?&nbsp; Is it next week, or the week
after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not go away!&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>The Doctor raised his eyebrows.&nbsp; &ldquo;Has he backed
out?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have broken off my engagement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Broken it off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have asked him to leave New York, and he has gone
away for a long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor was both puzzled and disappointed, but he solved
his perplexity by saying to himself that his daughter simply
misrepresented&mdash;justifiably, if one would? but nevertheless
misrepresented&mdash;the facts; and he eased off his
disappointment, which was that of a man losing a chance for a
little triumph that he had rather counted on, by a few words that
he uttered aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does he take his dismissal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo; said Catherine, less
ingeniously than she had hitherto spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t care?&nbsp; You are rather
cruel, after encouraging him and playing with him for so
long!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor had his revenge, after all.</p>
<h2><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>XXXII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Our</span> story has hitherto moved with
very short steps, but as it approaches its termination it must
take a long stride.&nbsp; As time went on, it might have appeared
to the Doctor that his daughter&rsquo;s account of her rupture
with Morris Townsend, mere bravado as he had deemed it, was in
some degree justified by the sequel.&nbsp; Morris remained as
rigidly and unremittingly absent as if he had died of a broken
heart, and Catherine had apparently buried the memory of this
fruitless episode as deep as if it had terminated by her own
choice.&nbsp; We know that she had been deeply and incurably
wounded, but the Doctor had no means of knowing it.&nbsp; He was
certainly curious about it, and would have given a good deal to
discover the exact truth; but it was his punishment that he never
knew&mdash;his punishment, I mean, for the abuse of sarcasm in
his relations with his daughter.&nbsp; There was a good deal of
effective sarcasm in her keeping him in the dark, and the rest of
the world conspired with her, in this sense, to be
sarcastic.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman told him nothing, partly because
he never questioned her&mdash;he made too light of Mrs. Penniman
for that&mdash;and partly because she flattered herself that a
tormenting reserve, and a serene profession of ignorance, would
avenge her for his theory that she had meddled in the
matter.&nbsp; He went two or three times to see Mrs. Montgomery,
but Mrs. Montgomery had nothing to impart.&nbsp; She simply knew
that her brother&rsquo;s engagement was broken off, and now that
Miss Sloper was out of danger she preferred not to bear witness
in any way against Morris.&nbsp; She had done so
before&mdash;however unwillingly&mdash;because she was sorry for
Miss Sloper; but she was not sorry for Miss Sloper now&mdash;not
at all sorry.&nbsp; Morris had told her nothing about his
relations with Miss Sloper at the time, and he had told her
nothing since.&nbsp; He was always away, and he very seldom wrote
to her; she believed he had gone to California.&nbsp; Mrs. Almond
had, in her sister&rsquo;s phrase, &ldquo;taken up&rdquo;
Catherine violently since the recent catastrophe; but though the
girl was very grateful to her for her kindness, she revealed no
secrets, and the good lady could give the Doctor no
satisfaction.&nbsp; Even, however, had she been able to narrate
to him the private history of his daughter&rsquo;s unhappy love
affair, it would have given her a certain comfort to leave him in
ignorance; for Mrs. Almond was at this time not altogether in
sympathy with her brother.&nbsp; She had guessed for herself that
Catherine had been cruelly jilted&mdash;she knew nothing from
Mrs. Penniman, for Mrs. Penniman had not ventured to lay the
famous explanation of Morris&rsquo;s motives before Mrs. Almond,
though she had thought it good enough for Catherine&mdash;and she
pronounced her brother too consistently indifferent to what the
poor creature must have suffered and must still be
suffering.&nbsp; Dr. Sloper had his theory, and he rarely altered
his theories.&nbsp; The marriage would have been an abominable
one, and the girl had had a blessed escape.&nbsp; She was not to
be pitied for that, and to pretend to condole with her would have
been to make concessions to the idea that she had ever had a
right to think of Morris.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put my foot on this idea from the first, and I keep
it there now,&rdquo; said the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see anything cruel in that; one can&rsquo;t keep it there too
long.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this Mrs. Almond more than once replied
that if Catherine had got rid of her incongruous lover, she
deserved the credit of it, and that to bring herself to her
father&rsquo;s enlightened view of the matter must have cost her
an effort that he was bound to appreciate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am by no means sure she has got rid of him,&rdquo;
the Doctor said.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is not the smallest
probability that, after having been as obstinate as a mule for
two years, she suddenly became amenable to reason.&nbsp; It is
infinitely more probable that he got rid of her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the more reason you should be gentle with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I <i>am</i> gentle with her.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t do
the pathetic; I can&rsquo;t pump up tears, to look graceful, over
the most fortunate thing that ever happened to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no sympathy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Almond;
&ldquo;that was never your strong point.&nbsp; You have only to
look at her to see that, right or wrong, and whether the rupture
came from herself or from him, her poor little heart is
grievously bruised.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Handling bruises&mdash;and even dropping tears on
them&mdash;doesn&rsquo;t make them any better!&nbsp; My business
is to see she gets no more knocks, and that I shall carefully
attend to.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t at all recognise your
description of Catherine.&nbsp; She doesn&rsquo;t strike me in
the least as a young woman going about in search of a moral
poultice.&nbsp; In fact, she seems to me much better than while
the fellow was hanging about.&nbsp; She is perfectly comfortable
and blooming; she eats and sleeps, takes her usual exercise, and
overloads herself, as usual, with finery.&nbsp; She is always
knitting some purse or embroidering some handkerchief, and it
seems to me she turns these articles out about as fast as
ever.&nbsp; She hasn&rsquo;t much to say; but when had she
anything to say?&nbsp; She had her little dance, and now she is
sitting down to rest.&nbsp; I suspect that, on the whole, she
enjoys it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She enjoys it as people enjoy getting rid of a leg that
has been crushed.&nbsp; The state of mind after amputation is
doubtless one of comparative repose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If your leg is a metaphor for young Townsend, I can
assure you he has never been crushed.&nbsp; Crushed?&nbsp; Not
he!&nbsp; He is alive and perfectly intact, and that&rsquo;s why
I am not satisfied.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you have liked to kill him?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Almond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, very much.&nbsp; I think it is quite possible that
it is all a blind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A blind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An arrangement between them.&nbsp; <i>Il fait le
mort</i>, as they say in France; but he is looking out of the
corner of his eye.&nbsp; You can depend upon it he has not burned
his ships; he has kept one to come back in.&nbsp; When I am dead,
he will set sail again, and then she will marry him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is interesting to know that you accuse your only
daughter of being the vilest of hypocrites,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Almond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what difference her being my only
daughter makes.&nbsp; It is better to accuse one than a
dozen.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t accuse any one.&nbsp; There is not
the smallest hypocrisy about Catherine, and I deny that she even
pretends to be miserable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor&rsquo;s idea that the thing was a
&ldquo;blind&rdquo; had its intermissions and revivals; but it
may be said on the whole to have increased as he grew older;
together with his impression of Catherine&rsquo;s blooming and
comfortable condition.&nbsp; Naturally, if he had not found
grounds for viewing her as a lovelorn maiden during the year or
two that followed her great trouble, he found none at a time when
she had completely recovered her self-possession.&nbsp; He was
obliged to recognise the fact that if the two young people were
waiting for him to get out of the way, they were at least waiting
very patiently.&nbsp; He had heard from time to time that Morris
was in New York; but he never remained there long, and, to the
best of the Doctor&rsquo;s belief, had no communication with
Catherine.&nbsp; He was sure they never met, and he had reason to
suspect that Morris never wrote to her.&nbsp; After the letter
that has been mentioned, she heard from him twice again, at
considerable intervals; but on none of these occasions did she
write herself.&nbsp; On the other hand, as the Doctor observed,
she averted herself rigidly from the idea of marrying other
people.&nbsp; Her opportunities for doing so were not numerous,
but they occurred often enough to test her disposition.&nbsp; She
refused a widower, a man with a genial temperament, a handsome
fortune, and three little girls (he had heard that she was very
fond of children, and he pointed to his own with some
confidence); and she turned a deaf ear to the solicitations of a
clever young lawyer, who, with the prospect of a great practice,
and the reputation of a most agreeable man, had had the
shrewdness, when he came to look about him for a wife, to believe
that she would suit him better than several younger and prettier
girls.&nbsp; Mr. Macalister, the widower, had desired to make a
marriage of reason, and had chosen Catherine for what he supposed
to be her latent matronly qualities; but John Ludlow, who was a
year the girl&rsquo;s junior, and spoken of always as a young man
who might have his &ldquo;pick,&rdquo; was seriously in love with
her.&nbsp; Catherine, however, would never look at him; she made
it plain to him that she thought he came to see her too
often.&nbsp; He afterwards consoled himself, and married a very
different person, little Miss Sturtevant, whose attractions were
obvious to the dullest comprehension.&nbsp; Catherine, at the
time of these events, had left her thirtieth year well behind
her, and had quite taken her place as an old maid.&nbsp; Her
father would have preferred she should marry, and he once told
her that he hoped she would not be too fastidious.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
should like to see you an honest man&rsquo;s wife before I
die,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; This was after John Ludlow had been
compelled to give it up, though the Doctor had advised him to
persevere.&nbsp; The Doctor exercised no further pressure, and
had the credit of not &ldquo;worrying&rdquo; at all over his
daughter&rsquo;s singleness.&nbsp; In fact he worried rather more
than appeared, and there were considerable periods during which
he felt sure that Morris Townsend was hidden behind some
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;If he is not, why doesn&rsquo;t she
marry?&rdquo; he asked himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Limited as her
intelligence may be, she must understand perfectly well that she
is made to do the usual thing.&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine, however,
became an admirable old maid.&nbsp; She formed habits, regulated
her days upon a system of her own, interested herself in
charitable institutions, asylums, hospitals, and aid societies;
and went generally, with an even and noiseless step, about the
rigid business of her life.&nbsp; This life had, however, a
secret history as well as a public one&mdash;if I may talk of the
public history of a mature and diffident spinster for whom
publicity had always a combination of terrors.&nbsp; From her own
point of view the great facts of her career were that Morris
Townsend had trifled with her affection, and that her father had
broken its spring.&nbsp; Nothing could ever alter these facts;
they were always there, like her name, her age, her plain
face.&nbsp; Nothing could ever undo the wrong or cure the pain
that Morris had inflicted on her, and nothing could ever make her
feel towards her father as she felt in her younger years.&nbsp;
There was something dead in her life, and her duty was to try and
fill the void.&nbsp; Catherine recognised this duty to the
utmost; she had a great disapproval of brooding and moping.&nbsp;
She had, of course, no faculty for quenching memory in
dissipation; but she mingled freely in the usual gaieties of the
town, and she became at last an inevitable figure at all
respectable entertainments.&nbsp; She was greatly liked, and as
time went on she grew to be a sort of kindly maiden aunt to the
younger portion of society.&nbsp; Young girls were apt to confide
to her their love affairs (which they never did to Mrs.
Penniman), and young men to be fond of her without knowing
why.&nbsp; She developed a few harmless eccentricities; her
habits, once formed, were rather stiffly maintained; her
opinions, on all moral and social matters, were extremely
conservative; and before she was forty she was regarded as an
old-fashioned person, and an authority on customs that had passed
away.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman, in comparison, was quite a girlish
figure; she grew younger as she advanced in life.&nbsp; She lost
none of her relish for beauty and mystery, but she had little
opportunity to exercise it.&nbsp; With Catherine&rsquo;s later
wooers she failed to establish relations as intimate as those
which had given her so many interesting hours in the society of
Morris Townsend.&nbsp; These gentlemen had an indefinable
mistrust of her good offices, and they never talked to her about
Catherine&rsquo;s charms.&nbsp; Her ringlets, her buckles and
bangles, glistened more brightly with each succeeding year, and
she remained quite the same officious and imaginative Mrs.
Penniman, and the odd mixture of impetuosity and circumspection,
that we have hitherto known.&nbsp; As regards one point, however,
her circumspection prevailed, and she must be given due credit
for it.&nbsp; For upwards of seventeen years she never mentioned
Morris Townsend&rsquo;s name to her niece.&nbsp; Catherine was
grateful to her, but this consistent silence, so little in accord
with her aunt&rsquo;s character, gave her a certain alarm, and
she could never wholly rid herself of a suspicion that Mrs.
Penniman sometimes had news of him.</p>
<h2><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>XXXIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Little</span> by little Dr. Sloper had
retired from his profession; he visited only those patients in
whose symptoms he recognised a certain originality.&nbsp; He went
again to Europe, and remained two years; Catherine went with him,
and on this occasion Mrs. Penniman was of the party.&nbsp; Europe
apparently had few surprises for Mrs. Penniman, who frequently
remarked, in the most romantic sites&mdash;&ldquo;You know I am
very familiar with all this.&rdquo;&nbsp; It should be added that
such remarks were usually not addressed to her brother, or yet to
her niece, but to fellow-tourists who happened to be at hand, or
even to the cicerone or the goat-herd in the foreground.</p>
<p>One day, after his return from Europe, the Doctor said
something to his daughter that made her start&mdash;it seemed to
come from so far out of the past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like you to promise me something before I
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you talk about your dying?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I am sixty-eight years old.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope you will live a long time,&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope I shall!&nbsp; But some day I shall take a bad
cold, and then it will not matter much what any one hopes.&nbsp;
That will be the manner of my exit, and when it takes place,
remember I told you so.&nbsp; Promise me not to marry Morris
Townsend after I am gone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was what made Catherine start, as I have said; but her
start was a silent one, and for some moments she said
nothing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why do you speak of him?&rdquo; she asked
at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You challenge everything I say.&nbsp; I speak of him
because he&rsquo;s a topic, like any other.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s to
be seen, like any one else, and he is still looking for a
wife&mdash;having had one and got rid of her, I don&rsquo;t know
by what means.&nbsp; He has lately been in New York, and at your
cousin Marian&rsquo;s house; your Aunt Elizabeth saw him
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They neither of them told me,&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s their merit; it&rsquo;s not yours.&nbsp;
He has grown fat and bald, and he has not made his fortune.&nbsp;
But I can&rsquo;t trust those facts alone to steel your heart
against him, and that&rsquo;s why I ask you to
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fat and bald&rdquo;: these words presented a strange
image to Catherine&rsquo;s mind, out of which the memory of the
most beautiful young man in the world had never faded.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you understand,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I very seldom think of Mr. Townsend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be very easy for you to go on, then.&nbsp;
Promise me, after my death, to do the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again, for some moments, Catherine was silent; her
father&rsquo;s request deeply amazed her; it opened an old wound
and made it ache afresh.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I can
promise that,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be a great satisfaction,&rdquo; said her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t understand.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t promise
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor was silent a minute.&nbsp; &ldquo;I ask you for a
particular reason.&nbsp; I am altering my will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This reason failed to strike Catherine; and indeed she
scarcely understood it.&nbsp; All her feelings were merged in the
sense that he was trying to treat her as he had treated her years
before.&nbsp; She had suffered from it then; and now all her
experience, all her acquired tranquillity and rigidity,
protested.&nbsp; She had been so humble in her youth that she
could now afford to have a little pride, and there was something
in this request, and in her father&rsquo;s thinking himself so
free to make it, that seemed an injury to her dignity.&nbsp; Poor
Catherine&rsquo;s dignity was not aggressive; it never sat in
state; but if you pushed far enough you could find it.&nbsp; Her
father had pushed very far.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t promise,&rdquo; she simply repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very obstinate,&rdquo; said the Doctor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please explain, then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t explain,&rdquo; said Catherine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I can&rsquo;t promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; her father explained, &ldquo;I had
no idea how obstinate you are!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She knew herself that she was obstinate, and it gave her a
certain joy.&nbsp; She was now a middle-aged woman.</p>
<p>About a year after this, the accident that the Doctor had
spoken of occurred; he took a violent cold.&nbsp; Driving out to
Bloomingdale one April day to see a patient of unsound mind, who
was confined in a private asylum for the insane, and whose family
greatly desired a medical opinion from an eminent source, he was
caught in a spring shower, and being in a buggy, without a hood,
he found himself soaked to the skin.&nbsp; He came home with an
ominous chill, and on the morrow he was seriously ill.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is congestion of the lungs,&rdquo; he said to
Catherine; &ldquo;I shall need very good nursing.&nbsp; It will
make no difference, for I shall not recover; but I wish
everything to be done, to the smallest detail, as if I
should.&nbsp; I hate an ill-conducted sick-room; and you will be
so good as to nurse me on the hypothesis that I shall get
well.&rdquo;&nbsp; He told her which of his fellow-physicians to
send for, and gave her a multitude of minute directions; it was
quite on the optimistic hypothesis that she nursed him.&nbsp; But
he had never been wrong in his life, and he was not wrong
now.&nbsp; He was touching his seventieth year, and though he had
a very well-tempered constitution, his hold upon life had lost
its firmness.&nbsp; He died after three weeks&rsquo; illness,
during which Mrs. Penniman, as well as his daughter, had been
assiduous at his bedside.</p>
<p>On his will being opened after a decent interval, it was found
to consist of two portions.&nbsp; The first of these dated from
ten years back, and consisted of a series of dispositions by
which he left the great mass of property to his daughter, with
becoming legacies to his two sisters.&nbsp; The second was a
codicil, of recent origin, maintaining the annuities to Mrs.
Penniman and Mrs. Almond, but reducing Catherine&rsquo;s share to
a fifth of what he had first bequeathed her.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is
amply provided for from her mother&rsquo;s side,&rdquo; the
document ran, &ldquo;never having spent more than a fraction of
her income from this source; so that her fortune is already more
than sufficient to attract those unscrupulous adventurers whom
she has given me reason to believe that she persists in regarding
as an interesting class.&rdquo;&nbsp; The large remainder of his
property, therefore, Dr. Sloper had divided into seven unequal
parts, which he left, as endowments, to as many different
hospitals and schools of medicine, in various cities of the
Union.</p>
<p>To Mrs. Penniman it seemed monstrous that a man should play
such tricks with other people&rsquo;s money; for after his death,
of course, as she said, it was other people&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course, you will dispute the will,&rdquo; she remarked,
fatuously, to Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Catherine answered, &ldquo;I like it very
much.&nbsp; Only I wish it had been expressed a little
differently!&rdquo;</p>
<h2><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
221</span>XXXIV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was her habit to remain in town
very late in the summer; she preferred the house in Washington
Square to any other habitation whatever, and it was under protest
that she used to go to the seaside for the month of August.&nbsp;
At the sea she spent her month at an hotel.&nbsp; The year that
her father died she intermitted this custom altogether, not
thinking it consistent with deep mourning; and the year after
that she put off her departure till so late that the middle of
August found her still in the heated solitude of Washington
Square.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman, who was fond of a change, was
usually eager for a visit to the country; but this year she
appeared quite content with such rural impressions as she could
gather, at the parlour window, from the ailantus-trees behind the
wooden paling.&nbsp; The peculiar fragrance of this vegetation
used to diffuse itself in the evening air, and Mrs. Penniman, on
the warm nights of July, often sat at the open window and inhaled
it.&nbsp; This was a happy moment for Mrs. Penniman; after the
death of her brother she felt more free to obey her
impulses.&nbsp; A vague oppression had disappeared from her life,
and she enjoyed a sense of freedom of which she had not been
conscious since the memorable time, so long ago, when the Doctor
went abroad with Catherine and left her at home to entertain
Morris Townsend.&nbsp; The year that had elapsed since her
brother&rsquo;s death reminded her&mdash;of that happy time,
because, although Catherine, in growing older, had become a
person to be reckoned with, yet her society was a very different
thing, as Mrs. Penniman said, from that of a tank of cold
water.&nbsp; The elder lady hardly knew what use to make of this
larger margin of her life; she sat and looked at it very much as
she had often sat, with her poised needle in her hand, before her
tapestry frame.&nbsp; She had a confident hope, however, that her
rich impulses, her talent for embroidery, would still find their
application, and this confidence was justified before many months
had elapsed.</p>
<p>Catherine continued to live in her father&rsquo;s house in
spite of its being represented to her that a maiden lady of quiet
habits might find a more convenient abode in one of the smaller
dwellings, with brown stone fronts, which had at this time begun
to adorn the transverse thoroughfares in the upper part of the
town.&nbsp; She liked the earlier structure&mdash;it had begun by
this time to be called an &ldquo;old&rdquo; house&mdash;and
proposed to herself to end her days in it.&nbsp; If it was too
large for a pair of unpretending gentlewomen, this was better
than the opposite fault; for Catherine had no desire to find
herself in closer quarters with her aunt.&nbsp; She expected to
spend the rest of her life in Washington Square, and to enjoy
Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s society for the whole of this period; as
she had a conviction that, long as she might live, her aunt would
live at least as long, and always retain her brilliancy and
activity.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman suggested to her the idea of a rich
vitality.</p>
<p>On one of those warm evenings in July of which mention has
been made, the two ladies sat together at an open window, looking
out on the quiet Square.&nbsp; It was too hot for lighted lamps,
for reading, or for work; it might have appeared too hot even for
conversation, Mrs. Penniman having long been speechless.&nbsp;
She sat forward in the window, half on the balcony, humming a
little song.&nbsp; Catherine was within the room, in a low
rocking-chair, dressed in white, and slowly using a large
palmetto fan.&nbsp; It was in this way, at this season, that the
aunt and niece, after they had had tea, habitually spent their
evenings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman at last, &ldquo;I
am going to say something that will surprise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray do,&rdquo; Catherine answered; &ldquo;I like
surprises.&nbsp; And it is so quiet now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, I have seen Morris Townsend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If Catherine was surprised, she checked the expression of it;
she gave neither a start nor an exclamation.&nbsp; She remained,
indeed, for some moments intensely still, and this may very well
have been a symptom of emotion.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope he was
well,&rdquo; she said at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; he is a great deal changed.&nbsp;
He would like very much to see you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would rather not see him,&rdquo; said Catherine
quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you would say that.&nbsp; But you
don&rsquo;t seem surprised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am&mdash;very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met him at Marian&rsquo;s,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; &ldquo;He goes to Marian&rsquo;s, and they are so
afraid you will meet him there.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my belief that
that&rsquo;s why he goes.&nbsp; He wants so much to see
you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine made no response to this, and Mrs.
Penniman went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know him at first;
he is so remarkably changed.&nbsp; But he knew me in a
minute.&nbsp; He says I am not in the least changed.&nbsp; You
know how polite he always was.&nbsp; He was coming away when I
came, and we walked a little distance together.&nbsp; He is still
very handsome, only, of course, he looks older, and he is not
so&mdash;so animated as he used to be.&nbsp; There was a touch of
sadness about him; but there was a touch of sadness about him
before&mdash;especially when he went away.&nbsp; I am afraid he
has not been very successful&mdash;that he has never got
thoroughly established.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t suppose he is
sufficiently plodding, and that, after all, is what succeeds in
this world.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman had not mentioned Morris
Townsend&rsquo;s name to her niece for upwards of the fifth of a
century; but now that she had broken the spell, she seemed to
wish to make up for lost time, as if there had been a sort of
exhilaration in hearing herself talk of him.&nbsp; She proceeded,
however, with considerable caution, pausing occasionally to let
Catherine give some sign.&nbsp; Catherine gave no other sign than
to stop the rocking of her chair and the swaying of her fan; she
sat motionless and silent.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was on Tuesday
last,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman, &ldquo;and I have been
hesitating ever since about telling you.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t
know how you might like it.&nbsp; At last I thought that it was
so long ago that you would probably not have any particular
feeling.&nbsp; I saw him again, after meeting him at
Marian&rsquo;s.&nbsp; I met him in the street, and he went a few
steps with me.&nbsp; The first thing he said was about you; he
asked ever so many questions.&nbsp; Marian didn&rsquo;t want me
to speak to you; she didn&rsquo;t want you to know that they
receive him.&nbsp; I told him I was sure that after all these
years you couldn&rsquo;t have any feeling about that; you
couldn&rsquo;t grudge him the hospitality of his own
cousin&rsquo;s house.&nbsp; I said you would be bitter indeed if
you did that.&nbsp; Marian has the most extraordinary ideas about
what happened between you; she seems to think he behaved in some
very unusual manner.&nbsp; I took the liberty of reminding her of
the real facts, and placing the story in its true light.&nbsp;
<i>He</i> has no bitterness, Catherine, I can assure you; and he
might be excused for it, for things have not gone well with
him.&nbsp; He has been all over the world, and tried to establish
himself everywhere; but his evil star was against him.&nbsp; It
is most interesting to hear him talk of his evil star.&nbsp;
Everything failed; everything but his&mdash;you know, you
remember&mdash;his proud, high spirit.&nbsp; I believe he married
some lady somewhere in Europe.&nbsp; You know they marry in such
a peculiar matter-of-course way in Europe; a marriage of reason
they call it.&nbsp; She died soon afterwards; as he said to me,
she only flitted across his life.&nbsp; He has not been in New
York for ten years; he came back a few days ago.&nbsp; The first
thing he did was to ask me about you.&nbsp; He had heard you had
never married; he seemed very much interested about that.&nbsp;
He said you had been the real romance of his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine had suffered her companion to proceed from point to
point, and pause to pause, without interrupting her; she fixed
her eyes on the ground and listened.&nbsp; But the last phrase I
have quoted was followed by a pause of peculiar significance, and
then, at last, Catherine spoke.&nbsp; It will be observed that
before doing so she had received a good deal of information about
Morris Townsend.&nbsp; &ldquo;Please say no more; please
don&rsquo;t follow up that subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t it interest you?&rdquo; asked Mrs.
Penniman, with a certain timorous archness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It pains me,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was afraid you would say that.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t
you think you could get used to it?&nbsp; He wants so much to see
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t, Aunt Lavinia,&rdquo; said
Catherine, getting up from her seat.&nbsp; She moved quickly
away, and went to the other window, which stood open to the
balcony; and here, in the embrasure, concealed from her aunt by
the white curtains, she remained a long time, looking out into
the warm darkness.&nbsp; She had had a great shock; it was as if
the gulf of the past had suddenly opened, and a spectral figure
had risen out of it.&nbsp; There were some things she believed
she had got over, some feelings that she had thought of as dead;
but apparently there was a certain vitality in them still.&nbsp;
Mrs. Penniman had made them stir themselves.&nbsp; It was but a
momentary agitation, Catherine said to herself; it would
presently pass away.&nbsp; She was trembling, and her heart was
beating so that she could feel it; but this also would
subside.&nbsp; Then, suddenly, while she waited for a return of
her calmness, she burst into tears.&nbsp; But her tears flowed
very silently, so that Mrs. Penniman had no observation of
them.&nbsp; It was perhaps, however, because Mrs. Penniman
suspected them that she said no more that evening about Morris
Townsend.</p>
<h2><a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>XXXV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Her</span> refreshed attention to this
gentleman had not those limits of which Catherine desired, for
herself, to be conscious; it lasted long enough to enable her to
wait another week before speaking of him again.&nbsp; It was
under the same circumstances that she once more attacked the
subject.&nbsp; She had been sitting with her niece in the
evening; only on this occasion, as the night was not so warm, the
lamp had been lighted, and Catherine had placed herself near it
with a morsel of fancy-work.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman went and sat
alone for half an hour on the balcony; then she came in, moving
vaguely about the room.&nbsp; At last she sank into a seat near
Catherine, with clasped hands, and a little look of
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall you be angry if I speak to you again about
<i>him</i>?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Catherine looked up at her quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who is
<i>he</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He whom you once loved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not be angry, but I shall not like
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sent you a message,&rdquo; said Mrs. Penniman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I promised him to deliver it, and I must keep my
promise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In all these years Catherine had had time to forget how little
she had to thank her aunt for in the season of her misery; she
had long ago forgiven Mrs. Penniman for taking too much upon
herself.&nbsp; But for a moment this attitude of interposition
and disinterestedness, this carrying of messages and redeeming of
promises, brought back the sense that her companion was a
dangerous woman.&nbsp; She had said she would not be angry; but
for an instant she felt sore.&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care
what you do with your promise!&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>Mrs. Penniman, however, with her high conception of the
sanctity of pledges, carried her point.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have gone
too far to retreat,&rdquo; she said, though precisely what this
meant she was not at pains to explain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Townsend
wishes most particularly to see you, Catherine; he believes that
if you knew how much, and why, he wishes it, you would consent to
do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There can be no reason,&rdquo; said Catherine;
&ldquo;no good reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His happiness depends upon it.&nbsp; Is not that a good
reason?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Penniman impressively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for me.&nbsp; My happiness does not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you will be happier after you have seen
him.&nbsp; He is going away again&mdash;going to resume his
wanderings.&nbsp; It is a very lonely, restless, joyless
life.&nbsp; Before he goes he wishes to speak to you; it is a
fixed idea with him&mdash;he is always thinking of it.&nbsp; He
has something very important to say to you.&nbsp; He believes
that you never understood him&mdash;that you never judged him
rightly, and the belief has always weighed upon him
terribly.&nbsp; He wishes to justify himself; he believes that in
a very few words he could do so.&nbsp; He wishes to meet you as a
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine listened to this wonderful speech without pausing in
her work; she had now had several days to accustom herself to
think of Morris Townsend again as an actuality.&nbsp; When it was
over she said simply, &ldquo;Please say to Mr. Townsend that I
wish he would leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She had hardly spoken when a sharp, firm ring at the door
vibrated through the summer night.&nbsp; Catherine looked up at
the clock; it marked a quarter-past nine&mdash;a very late hour
for visitors, especially in the empty condition of the
town.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman at the same moment gave a little start,
and then Catherine&rsquo;s eyes turned quickly to her aunt.&nbsp;
They met Mrs. Penniman&rsquo;s and sounded them for a moment,
sharply.&nbsp; Mrs. Penniman was blushing; her look was a
conscious one; it seemed to confess something.&nbsp; Catherine
guessed its meaning, and rose quickly from her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Penniman,&rdquo; she said, in a tone that scared
her companion, &ldquo;have you taken the <i>liberty</i> . . .
?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dearest Catherine,&rdquo; stammered Mrs. Penniman,
&ldquo;just wait till you see him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Catherine had frightened her aunt, but she was also frightened
herself; she was on the point of rushing to give orders to the
servant, who was passing to the door, to admit no one; but the
fear of meeting her visitor checked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morris Townsend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was what she heard, vaguely but recognisably articulated
by the domestic, while she hesitated.&nbsp; She had her back
turned to the door of the parlour, and for some moments she kept
it turned, feeling that he had come in.&nbsp; He had not spoken,
however, and at last she faced about.&nbsp; Then she saw a
gentleman standing in the middle of the room, from which her aunt
had discreetly retired.</p>
<p>She would never have known him.&nbsp; He was forty-five years
old, and his figure was not that of the straight, slim young man
she remembered.&nbsp; But it was a very fine person, and a fair
and lustrous beard, spreading itself upon a well-presented chest,
contributed to its effect.&nbsp; After a moment Catherine
recognised the upper half of the face, which, though her
visitor&rsquo;s clustering locks had grown thin, was still
remarkably handsome.&nbsp; He stood in a deeply deferential
attitude, with his eyes on her face.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
ventured&mdash;I have ventured,&rdquo; he said; and then he
paused, looking about him, as if he expected her to ask him to
sit down.&nbsp; It was the old voice, but it had not the old
charm.&nbsp; Catherine, for a minute, was conscious of a distinct
determination not to invite him to take a seat.&nbsp; Why had he
come?&nbsp; It was wrong for him to come.&nbsp; Morris was
embarrassed, but Catherine gave him no help.&nbsp; It was not
that she was glad of his embarrassment; on the contrary, it
excited all her own liabilities of this kind, and gave her great
pain.&nbsp; But how could she welcome him when she felt so
vividly that he ought not to have come?&nbsp; &ldquo;I wanted so
much&mdash;I was determined,&rdquo; Morris went on.&nbsp; But he
stopped again; it was not easy.&nbsp; Catherine still said
nothing, and he may well have recalled with apprehension her
ancient faculty of silence.&nbsp; She continued to look at him,
however, and as she did so she made the strangest
observation.&nbsp; It seemed to be he, and yet not he; it was the
man who had been everything, and yet this person was
nothing.&nbsp; How long ago it was&mdash;how old she had
grown&mdash;how much she had lived!&nbsp; She had lived on
something that was connected with <i>him</i>, and she had
consumed it in doing so.&nbsp; This person did not look
unhappy.&nbsp; He was fair and well-preserved, perfectly dressed,
mature and complete.&nbsp; As Catherine looked at him, the story
of his life defined itself in his eyes; he had made himself
comfortable, and he had never been caught.&nbsp; But even while
her perception opened itself to this, she had no desire to catch
him; his presence was painful to her, and she only wished he
would go.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you not sit down?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had better not,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I offend you by coming?&rdquo;&nbsp; He was very grave;
he spoke in a tone of the richest respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think you ought to have come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did not Mrs. Penniman tell you&mdash;did she not give
you my message?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She told me something, but I did not
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you would let <i>me</i> tell you&mdash;let me
speak for myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is necessary,&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for you, perhaps, but for me.&nbsp; It would be a
great satisfaction&mdash;and I have not many.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
seemed to be coming nearer; Catherine turned away.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Can we not be friends again?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not enemies,&rdquo; said Catherine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have none but friendly feelings to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I wonder whether you know the happiness it gives me
to hear you say that!&rdquo;&nbsp; Catherine uttered no
intimation that she measured the influence of her words; and he
presently went on, &ldquo;You have not changed&mdash;the years
have passed happily for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have passed very quietly,&rdquo; said
Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They have left no marks; you are admirably
young.&rdquo;&nbsp; This time he succeeded in coming
nearer&mdash;he was close to her; she saw his glossy perfumed
beard, and his eyes above it looking strange and hard.&nbsp; It
was very different from his old&mdash;from his
young&mdash;face.&nbsp; If she had first seen him this way she
would not have liked him.&nbsp; It seemed to her that he was
smiling, or trying to smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Catherine,&rdquo; he
said, lowering his voice, &ldquo;I have never ceased to think of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t say those things,&rdquo; she
answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hate me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>Something in her tone discouraged him, but in a moment he
recovered himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Have you still some kindness for
me, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know why you have come here to ask me
such things!&rdquo; Catherine exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because for many years it has been the desire of my
life that we should be friends again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is impossible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so?&nbsp; Not if you will allow it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not allow it!&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>He looked at her again in silence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see; my
presence troubles you and pains you.&nbsp; I will go away; but
you must give me leave to come again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t come again,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never?&mdash;never?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made a great effort; she wished to say something that
would make it impossible he should ever again cross her
threshold.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is wrong of you.&nbsp; There is no
propriety in it&mdash;no reason for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, dearest lady, you do me injustice!&rdquo; cried
Morris Townsend.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have only waited, and now we are
free.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You treated me badly,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if you think of it rightly.&nbsp; You had your
quiet life with your father&mdash;which was just what I could not
make up my mind to rob you of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; I had that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris felt it to be a considerable damage to his cause that
he could not add that she had had something more besides; for it
is needless to say that he had learnt the contents of Dr.
Sloper&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; He was nevertheless not at a
loss.&nbsp; &ldquo;There are worse fates than that!&rdquo; he
exclaimed, with expression; and he might have been supposed to
refer to his own unprotected situation.&nbsp; Then he added, with
a deeper tenderness, &ldquo;Catherine, have you never forgiven
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I forgave you years ago, but it is useless for us to
attempt to be friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not if we forget the past.&nbsp; We have still a
future, thank God!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forget&mdash;I don&rsquo;t forget,&rdquo;
said Catherine.&nbsp; &ldquo;You treated me too badly.&nbsp; I
felt it very much; I felt it for years.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then she
went on, with her wish to show him that he must not come to her
this way, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t begin again&mdash;I can&rsquo;t
take it up.&nbsp; Everything is dead and buried.&nbsp; It was too
serious; it made a great change in my life.&nbsp; I never
expected to see you here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you are angry!&rdquo; cried Morris, who wished
immensely that he could extort some flash of passion from her
mildness.&nbsp; In that case he might hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I am not angry.&nbsp; Anger does not last, that
way, for years.&nbsp; But there are other things.&nbsp;
Impressions last, when they have been strong.&nbsp; But I
can&rsquo;t talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Morris stood stroking his beard, with a clouded eye.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why have you never married?&rdquo; he asked
abruptly.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have had opportunities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t wish to marry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, you are rich, you are free; you had nothing to
gain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had nothing to gain,&rdquo; said Catherine.</p>
<p>Morris looked vaguely round him, and gave a deep sigh.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, I was in hopes that we might still have been
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I meant to tell you, by my aunt, in answer to your
message&mdash;if you had waited for an answer&mdash;that it was
unnecessary for you to come in that hope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; said Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;Excuse
my indiscretion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bowed, and she turned away&mdash;standing there, averted,
with her eyes on the ground, for some moments after she had heard
him close the door of the room.</p>
<p>In the hall he found Mrs. Penniman, fluttered and eager; she
appeared to have been hovering there under the irreconcilable
promptings of her curiosity and her dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a precious plan of yours!&rdquo; said Morris,
clapping on his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she so hard?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Penniman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t care a button for me&mdash;with her
confounded little dry manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was it very dry?&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Penniman, with
solicitude.</p>
<p>Morris took no notice of her question; he stood musing an
instant, with his hat on.&nbsp; &ldquo;But why the deuce, then,
would she never marry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;why indeed?&rdquo; sighed Mrs.
Penniman.&nbsp; And then, as if from a sense of the inadequacy of
this explanation, &ldquo;But you will not despair&mdash;you will
come back?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come back?&nbsp; Damnation!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Morris
Townsend strode out of the house, leaving Mrs. Penniman
staring.</p>
<p>Catherine, meanwhile, in the parlour, picking up her morsel of
fancy work, had seated herself with it again&mdash;for life, as
it were.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
